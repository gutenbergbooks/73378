<p class="drop-cap">THE hero of this book was a real man, though he
has carried to his grave the secret of his true
name. It was not Boynton, although it is known that
he was born in Fifth Avenue, near Fourteenth Street,
New York, May 1, 1842, and that his father was a
distinguished surgeon, with an estate on Lake Champlain.
He rarely talked of his remarkable life, and
recounted in detail to the author of this volume the
facts of his career of adventure, only in the closing
months of his life.</p>

<p>Captain Boynton was of the type of filibuster that is
read of so often, but rarely met with in life. He was
a tall, bronzed, athletic, broad-shouldered man, one of
the most picturesque and daring of the many soldiers
of fortune who have sought adventures over the
world. From Hongkong to Valparaiso fighters of all
races knew the name of Boynton. From Cape Horn
to New York he did not permit himself to be forgotten.
Whether exploring the sources of the Orinoco,
or hunting elusive supporters for a deserted
American President, or battling in the Haytian army,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
or spying out court secrets in Venezuela, or running
a distillery in Brooklyn with Jim Fisk as partner, he
was invariably master of himself and continually a
personality to be reckoned with. Captain Boynton
was the original of the “Soldier of Fortune” in Richard
Harding Davis’s story of that name, and gave to
Guy Boothby the facts of his novel “The Beautiful
White Devil,” with which dashing heroine Captain
Boynton was on terms of intimacy. In the account of
his life given in this volume fictitious names have in
two or three instances been used for persons still living
who figured in business deals with him. Otherwise
the story is told almost identically as Captain
Boynton narrated it to the author.</p>

<p>After escaping death in scores of forms, including
a Chinese pirate’s cutlass, an assassin’s dagger, the
fire of a file of soldiers at sunrise, and war’s guns, this
utterly fearless, cheerfully arrogant retired blockade
runner, revolutionist, and hunter of pirates died peacefully
in his bed, at a ripe age, on January 19, 1911, in
New York City, where he had led a quiet life since
1905, when he voluntarily left Venezuela, after withstanding
repeated efforts by President Castro to drive
him from the country.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE’S CREED</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THROUGHOUT my life I have sought adventure
over the face of the world and its waters as other
men have hunted and fought for gold or struggled
for fame. The love of it, whether through the outcropping
of a strain of buccaneer blood that had been
held in subjection by generations of placid propriety or
as a result of some freak of prenatal suggestion, was
born in me, deep-planted and long-rooted. Excitement
is as essential to my existence as air and food.
Through it my life has been prolonged in activity and
my soul perpetuated in youth; when I can no longer
enjoy its electrification, Death, as it is so spoken of,
will, I hope, come quickly.</p>

<p>To get away from the flat, tiresome, beaten path
and find conditions or create situations to gratify
the clamorous demand within me has ever been my
compelling passion. I have served, all told, under
eighteen flags and to each I gave the best that was in
me, even though some of them were disappointing in
their failure to produce a pleasing amount of excitement.
In following my natural bent, which I was
powerless, as well as disinclined, to interfere with or
alter, to the full length of my capabilities, it perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
will be considered by some people that I have gone
outside of written laws. To such a contention my
answer is that I have always been true to my own
conscience, which is the known and yet the unknown
quantity we all must reckon with, and to my country.
In the transportation of arms with which to further
fights for freedom or fortune I have flown many flags
I had no strictly legal right to fly, over ships that
were not what they pretended to be nor what their
papers indicated them to be, but never have I taken
refuge behind the Stars and Stripes, nor have I ever
called on an American minister or consular officer to
get me out of the successive scrapes with governments,
but most often with misgovernments, into
which my warring wanderings have carried me. Red-blooded
love of adventure, free from any wanton spirit
and with the prospect of financial reward always subordinated,
has been the driving force in all of my
encounters with good men and bad, with the latter
class much in the majority. Therefore I have only
scorn for sympathy and contempt for criticism, nor
am I troubled with uncanny visions by night nor
haunting recollections by day.</p>

<p>There is just one point in my philosophy which I
wish to make clear before the Blue Peter is hoisted,
and that is that most of the so-called impossibilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
we encounter are simply disguised opportunities.
Because they are regarded as impossible they are not
guarded against and are therefore comparatively easy
of accomplishment when they really are possible, as
most of them are. Acceptance of this theory, with
which every student of the history of warfare will
agree, will help to explain my ability to do some of
the things which will be told of, that the thoughtless
would promptly put down as impossible.</p>

<p>The name by which I am known is one of the contradictions
of my life. Save only for my father, who
sympathized with my adventurous disposition at the
same time that he tried to curb it, I was at war with
my family almost from the time I could talk. I am a
Republican in politics from the fact that they were
active supporters of James Buchanan, and I became
a Southern sympathizer simply because they were
bitterly opposed to slavery. When I left home to
become an adventurer around the globe I buried my
real name and I do not propose to uncover it, here
or hereafter. I am proud, though, of the fact that
my family is descended from a King of Burgundy;
for since reaching years of discretion, though I have
been as loyal to the United States as any man since
1865, I never have believed in a republican form of
government. In the course of my activities I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
used many names in many lands, but that of Boynton,
which had been in the family for years, stuck to
me until I finally adopted it, prefixing a “George” and
a “B.,” which really stands for “Boynton.” I made it
my business to forget, as soon as they had served
my purpose, the different names I took in response to
the demand of expediency, but I remember that Kinnear
and Henderson were two under which I created
some comment on opposite sides of the world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>UNDER FIRE THE FIRST TIME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; WAS born on May 1, 1842, on Fifth Avenue,
New York, not a long way north of Washington
Square. My father was a distinguished surgeon and
owned a large estate on Lake Champlain, where
most of my youthful summers were spent. I had
three brothers and two sisters; but not for many years
have I known where they are, or whether alive or
dead. After having had a private tutor at home I
was educated by jumps at the Hinesburgh, Vermont,
Academy; at the old Troy Conference Academy at
Poultney, Vermont, and at the Burlington, Vermont,
Academy, where, young as I was, I became deeply interested
in the study of medicine, for which I had inherited
a pronounced liking; that was the one point on
which I seemed to fit in with the family. I did not stay
a great while at any institution because of my success
in leading the other students into all sorts of
dare-devil pranks, to the detriment of discipline and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the despair of the dominies. As an evidence of the
inclining twig I remember, with still some feeling of
pride, that during one of my last summers on Lake
Champlain I organized fifteen boys of the neighborhood
into an expedition against the Indians of the
far West. We were equipped with blankets stolen
from our beds, three flasks of powder, and nearly one
hundred pounds of lead, which was to be moulded
into bullets for the extermination of the redskins of
the world. As Commander-in-Chief I carried the
only pistol in the party but we expected to seize
additional arms on the way to the battlefields. I had
scouts ahead of us and on both flanks and by avoiding
the roads and the bank of the lake we managed to
evade capture until the third day, although the whole
countryside was searching for us, in rather hysterical
fashion.</p>

<p>After a somewhat scattered series of escapades,
which increased the ire of the family and intensified
my dislike of their prosaic protestations, my father
solemnly declared his intention of sending me to the
United States Naval Academy. It was his idea, as he
expressed it, that the discipline which prevailed there
would be sufficient to restrain me and at the same
time my active imagination would find a vent in my
inborn love of the sea. I was delighted with this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
promised realization of my boyhood dream, for it
seemed to me that the career of a naval officer presented
greater possibilities of adventure than any
other. Former Congressman George P. Marsh, of
Burlington, Vermont, an old friend of the family, who
afterward was sent to Italy as American Minister
and died there, arranged to secure my appointment
to Annapolis, and I entered a preparatory school to
brush up on the studies required by the entrance
examination. The machinery to procure my appointment
had been set in motion and I was ready to take
the examination when the opening gun of the Civil
War was fired at Fort Sumter, on April 12, 1861.</p>

<p>I was immediately seized with a wild desire to be
in the fight, but my father would not consent to it, on
account of my age. He would not hear to my going
into the army as a private but promised that if I
would wait a year, and was still of the same mind,
he would try to get me a commission. As I have said,
my sympathies were with the South but it was more
convenient for me to take the other side, and at that
moment I was not particular about principles. The
family were duly horrified one evening when I went
home, after some things I needed, and told them I
had enlisted. The next day my father bought my discharge
and hustled me out to the little town of Woodstock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Illinois, where I was placed in charge of an uncle
who was abjured to keep me from going to war, without
regard to anything else that might happen. He
prevented me from joining an infantry regiment
which was then forming but I got away with a cavalry
regiment which was raised in that section some
months later, and was made one of its officers. We
went to Cairo, Illinois, and from there by transport to
Pittsburg Landing, where we arrived just in time to
take part in the battle which was fought on April 6
and 7, 1862. My regiment was pitted against the
famous Black Horse Cavalry of Mississippi and we
came together at the gallop. I was riding a demon
of a black horse and, with the bit in his teeth, he
charged into the line two or three lengths ahead of
the rest. A Confederate officer came at me with his
sabre raised. I ducked my head behind my horse’s
neck and shot him between the eyes, but just as my
pistol cracked his sword cut through my horse’s head
to the brain and the point of it laid open my right
cheek, from the ear almost to the chin. The horse
fell on my leg and held me there, unconscious. In
the evening I was picked up and sent to the general
hospital, where I stayed for three weeks.</p>

<p>When I was discharged from the hospital I was
too weak for active service so I was sent into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Tennessee mountains in charge of a detachment to
intercept contraband which was being sent into the
South from Cincinnati. We had been there about
ten days when, early in the morning, one of the
patrols brought in a fine-looking young man, who
had been arrested as a spy. There was a refinement
about the prisoner that aroused my suspicions, and
during the day I satisfied myself that “he” was a
woman. While she would not acknowledge her identity,
I had reason to believe, and always have been
sure in my own mind, that she was none other than
Belle Boyd, the famous Confederate spy. I was born
with a fondness for women, which then was strong
within me, and besides, my heart was with her cause.
Therefore it is without apology that I say I arranged
things so that she escaped the next night through a
window in the shed in which she was confined.</p>

<p>Soon after my return to headquarters I contracted
a bad case of malaria and was sent home, which
meant back to Woodstock, where I had eloped with a
banker’s daughter just before going to the front. I
was disgusted with the war and I expressed myself
so freely, and was so outspoken in my sympathy for
the South, that I made myself extremely unpopular
in a very short time. It probably is true, too, as was
charged against me, that I swaggered around a lot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and presumed on the reputation I had made. At any
rate the people set their hearts on hanging me for
being a “damned copperhead,” and they might have
done it if old man Wellburn, the proprietor of the
hotel at which my wife and I were staying, had not
helped me to stand off a mob that came after me.
I met them at the door with a revolver in each
hand and Wellburn was right behind me with quite
an arsenal. They suggested that I come out and
renounce my principles and make certain promises,
or be hanged at the liberty pole. I told them I would
renounce nothing and promise less.</p>

<p>“If I am a copperhead,” I told them, “I am a fighting
copperhead, while you are neither kind. If you
want a fight why don’t you go to the front and get it,
instead of staying home and making trouble for a
better man, who has fought and bled for the cause you
are shouting about? If you prefer a fight here, come
on and get it. I’ve got twelve shots here and there
will be just thirteen of us in hell or heaven if you try
to make good your threat.”</p>

<p>Old Wellburn was known as a fighter and the
sight of his weapons added weight to my words,
so the crowd concluded to let me have my way about
it, and dispersed. That experience intensified my dissatisfaction
with the whole business and I sent in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
my resignation. It was accepted, and when I had
thought it all over I considered that I was lucky to
have escaped a court-martial. It was fortunate for
me that Governor “Dick” Yates and my father were
warm friends. The Governor was thoroughly disgusted
with the way I had conducted myself, but he
stood by me.</p>

<p>I then moved to Chicago, with my wife. She had
a small fortune and I had come into considerable
money on my twentieth birthday, so we were in easy
circumstances. I bought a vinegar works on Kinzie
Street; but the dull routine of business was repulsive
to me and I sold it in less than a year, after having
operated it at a handsome profit, and went on to New
York. We stopped at the old St. Nicholas, at Broadway
and Spring Street, which was the fashionable
hotel in those days.</p>

<p>I was looking for anything that promised excitement.
I had heard that Carlos Manuel de Cespedes
was fomenting a revolt in Cuba,—afterward known
as the “Ten Years’ War,”—and had conceived the idea
of taking a hand in it. To my disappointment, I found
that no Junta had been established in this country, nor,
so far as I could discover, were there any responsible
men in New York who were connected with the
revolution. While I was wondering how I could get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
into communication with Cespedes my interest was
aroused by a newspaper story of the new blockade
runner “Letter B,” which had made one round trip
from Bermuda to Beaufort, North Carolina, and was
being looked for again by the Federal fleet. The “Letter
B”—its name a play on words—was a long, low,
powerful, schooner-rigged steamship, built by Laird on
the Mersey. Though classed as a fifteen-knot ship
she could do sixteen or seventeen, fast going at
that time. The story which attracted my attention
told all about her and said there was so much money
in blockade running that the owners could well afford
to lose her after she had made three successful trips.</p>

<p>In five minutes I decided to become a blockade
runner and to buy the new and already famous ship,
if she was to be had at any price within reason. I
bought a letter of credit and took the next ship for
Bermuda. On my arrival there I found that the “Letter
B” had been expected in for several days from her
second trip and that there was considerable anxiety
about her. I also learned that her owner was building
a second ship on the same lines and for the same
trade. A fresh cargo of munitions of war was awaiting
the “Letter B,” and a ship was ready to take to
England the cotton she would bring. I got acquainted
with the agent for the blockade runner and, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
making sure that he had an ample power of attorney
from her owner, offered to buy her and take the
chance that she might never come in. He was not
disposed to sell, at first, and wanted me to wait until
the arrival of her owner, Joseph Berry, who was
daily expected from England.</p>

<p>After waiting and talking with the agent for several
days I said to him one morning: “It looks as
though your ship has been captured or sunk. I’ll
take a gambler’s chance that she hasn’t and will give
you fifty thousand dollars for her and twenty-five thousand
dollars for the cargo that is waiting for her; you
to take the cargo she brings in. I’ll give you three
hours to think it over.”</p>

<p>I figured that the waiting cargo of arms was worth
a couple of thousand dollars more than my offer but
it looked as though I was taking a long chance with
my offer for the ship. However, I had a “hunch,” or
whatever you want to call it, that she was all right,
and I never have had a well-defined “hunch” steer
me in anything but a safe course, wherefore I invariably
heed them. At the expiration of the time limit
there was not a sign of smoke in any direction and
the agent accepted my proposition. In half an hour
I had a bill of sale for the ship and the warehouse
receipts for the cargo of war supplies. At sunset<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
that day a ship came in from England with the former
owner. He criticised his agent sharply at first,
but found some consolation in the fact that the vessel
he was building would soon go into commission.
When two more days passed with no sign of the
anxiously looked for ship Mr. Berry concluded that
he had all the best of the bargain and complimented
his agent on his shrewdness.</p>

<p>On the third day the “Letter B” came tearing in,
pursued at long range by the U. S. S. “Powhatan,”
which proceeded to stand guard over the harbor,
keeping well offshore on account of the reefs and
shoals that were under her lee. The “Letter B” discharged
a full cargo of cotton and was turned over
to me. While her cargo of arms was going in I went
over her carefully and found her in excellent condition
and ready to go right back. She was unloaded
in twelve hours and all of her cargo was safely
stowed in another forty-eight hours. I took command
of her, with John B. Williams, her old captain,
as sailing master, and determined to put to sea at
once. I knew the “Powhatan” would not be looking
for us so soon and planned to catch her off her guard.</p>

<p>There was then no man-of-war entrance to the harbor
and it was necessary to enter and leave by daylight.
With the sun just high enough to let us get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
clear of the reefs before dark, and with the “Powhatan”
well offshore and at the farthest end of the
course she was lazily patrolling, we put to sea. The
“Powhatan” saw us sooner than I had expected she
would and started to head us off, but she was not
quick enough. The moment she swung around I
increased our speed to a point which the pilot loudly
swore would pile us up on the rocks, but it didn’t,
and when we cleared the passage we were all of four
miles in the lead. As I had figured, the “Powhatan”
did not suppose we would come out for at least a
week and was cruising slowly about with fires banked,
so it took her some time to get up a full head of steam.
She fired three or four shots at us but they fell far
short. As soon as it was dark, with all of our lights
doused, we turned and headed a little south of west
so as to come up to Charleston, South Carolina, which
was my objective point, from the south. At sunrise
we had the ocean to ourselves.</p>

<p>I started in at once to master practical navigation,
the theory of which I knew, and to familiarize myself
with the handling of a ship. I stood at the wheel for
hours at a time and almost wore out the instruments
taking reckonings by the sun and the stars. Navigation
came to me naturally, for I loved it, and in three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
days I would have been willing to undertake a cruise
around the world with a Chinese crew.</p>

<p>We arrived off Charleston late in the afternoon
and steamed up close inshore until we could make out
the smoke of the blockading fleet, standing well out,
in a semicircle. Then we dropped back a bit and
anchored. All of the conditions shaped themselves
to favor us. It was a murky night with a hard blow,
which came up late in the afternoon, and when we
got under way at midnight a good bit of a sea was
running. With the engines held down to about
half speed, but ready to do their best in a twinkling,
we headed for the harbor, standing as close inshore
as we dared go. We passed so close to the blockading
ship stationed at the lower end of the crescent
that she could not have depressed her guns enough
to hit us even if we had been discovered in time, but
she did not see us until we had passed her. Then
she let go at us with her bow guns and while they
did no damage, we were at such close quarters that
their flash gave the other ships a glimpse of us as
we darted away at full speed. They immediately
opened on us but, after the first minute or two, it
was a case of haphazard shooting with all of them.
They knew how they bore from the channel and,
making a guess at the proper allowance for our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
speed, they blazed away, hoping for the best but fearing
the worst. The first shells exploded close around
us and some of the fragments came aboard but no
one was injured. When I saw where they were firing
I threw my ship farther over toward Sullivan’s
Island, where she could go on account of her light
draft, and sailed quietly along into the harbor at
reduced speed. At daylight we went up to the dock
and were warmly welcomed.</p>

<p>Before the second night was half over we had
everything out of her and a full cargo of cotton aboard
and we steamed out at once. I knew the blockaders
would not expect us for at least four days and we
surprised them just as we had surprised the “Powhatan”
at Bermuda. It was a thick night and we sailed
right through the fleet, at half speed so as better to
avoid detection, but prepared to break and run for it
at the crack of a gun, without a shot being fired or
an extra light shown. As soon as we were clear of
the line we put on full speed and three days later we
were safe at Turk’s Island, the most southerly and
easterly of the Bahama Islands, off the coast of
Florida, which I had selected as a base of operations.
Though these islands ought long ago to have come
under the Stars and Stripes, as they eventually must,
they are still owned by England, and in those days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
they were a haven and a clearing house for the outsiders
who were actively aiding the Confederacy—for
a very substantial consideration. Most of the
blockade runners, including the “Banshee,” “Siren,”
“Robert E. Lee,” “Lady Stirling” and other famous
ships, were operating out of Nassau, which had the
advantage of closer proximity to the chief Southern
ports, being within six hundred miles of Charleston
and Wilmington. Turk’s Island was nine hundred
miles away, but I never have believed in following
the crowd. It is my rule to do things alone and in
my own way, as must be the practice of every
man who expects to succeed in any dangerous business.
It is no part of my philosophy to become a
party to a situation in which I may suffer from the
mistakes of others or in which others are likely to
get into trouble through any fault of mine. The
popularity of Nassau caused it to be closely watched
by the Federal cruisers that patrolled the Gulf
Stream, while the less important islands to the south
and east were practically unguarded.</p>

<p>Though precarious for the men who made them so,
those were plenteous days for the Bahamas, compared
with which the rich tourist toll since levied on the
then hated Yankees is but small change. The fortunes
yielded by blockade running seemed made by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
magic, so quick was the process. Cotton that was
bought in Charleston or Wilmington for ten cents a
pound sold for ten times as much in the Bahamas and
there were enormous profits in the return cargoes of
military supplies. The captains and crews shared in
the proceeds and the health of the Confederacy was
drunk continuously, and often riotously. By the time
I projected myself temporarily into this golden atmosphere
of abnormal activity, running the blockade had
become more of a business and less of a romance than
it was in the reckless early days of the war. The
fleet was made up of fast ships of light draft, especially
built to meet the needs and dangers of the trade,
and they were so much faster than the warships
which hunted them that the percentage captured was
relatively very small.</p>

<p>Before leaving Bermuda I had ordered a cargo of
munitions of war sent to Turk’s Island. We had to
wait nearly a month for this shipment to arrive but
the time was well spent in overhauling the engines
and putting the “Letter B” in perfect condition.</p>

<p>My second trip to Charleston furnished a degree of
excitement that exalted my soul. While we were
held up at Turk’s Island the blockading fleet had
been strengthened and supplemented by several small
and fast boats which cruised around outside of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
line. Without knowing this I had decided—it must
have been in response to a “hunch”—to make a dash
straight through the line and into the harbor. It
was fortunate that we followed this plan for they
were expecting us to come up from the south, hugging
the shore as we had done before, and if we had
taken that course they certainly would have sunk us
or forced us aground. We were proceeding cautiously
but did not think we were close to the danger
zone when suddenly one of the patrol ships picked
us up and opened fire. Her guns were no better than
peashooters but they gave the signal to the fleet and
instantly lights popped up all along the line ahead of
us. When caught in such a trap, if I had not been
thirsting for thrills, I would have shown them our
heels, for we could have gotten away without any
trouble; but the demon of dare-deviltry seized and
gripped me.</p>

<p>In the flashing lights ahead I saw all of the excitement
I had been longing for, and with an exultant
yell to the helmsman to “tell the engineer to give
her hell,” I pushed him aside and seized the wheel.
I fondled the spokes lovingly and leaned over them
in a tumult of joy. It was the great moment of
which I had dreamed from boyhood. I had anticipated
that when it came I would be considerably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
excited and forgetful of all my carefully thought
out plans for meeting an emergency, but to my surprise
I found that I was as cool as though we were
riding at anchor in New York Bay. In the first flash
I felt myself grow cold all over and then a gentle
current of electricity began running through me, as
though my heart had been transformed into a dynamo
and my veins into fine wires. The opening gun
cleared my mind of all its anxieties and intensified
its action. I remember that I took time to analyze
my feelings to make sure that I was calm and collected
and not stunned and stolid, and that I was
silent from choice and not through anything of fear.
I counted the blockading ships as their hidden lights
flashed out and wondered how their officers and
crews enjoyed being dragged out of their first sound
sleep by my impertinent little vessel. I measured the
distance we would have to go to clear their line and
tried to figure out, from a rough calculation as to the
number of their guns and the accuracy of their fire,
the mathematical probability of our being sunk.
Strange though it may seem, the possibility of our
capture never occurred to me. We might be sent to
the bottom, and would be if it were so decreed by
Fate, but otherwise we would get away, and the only
other question was as to the nature and extent of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
injuries. When we were fairly under their spiteful
guns I thought of what great sport it would be if we
could only return their fire on something like even
terms. I compared the wide, individualistic opportunity
of naval warfare with routine battles on land,
which are fought by rules laid down for every condition
that can arise, and unhesitatingly decided in
favor of the sea, with its long-nursed passion for the
man who dares its fury, and its despotism over him
who fears it.</p>

<p>As though spurred by a human impulse the good
little ship sprang forward as she felt the full force of
her engines, and never did she make such another race
of it as she did that night. In the sea then running
and at the speed we were going we would ordinarily
have had two men at the wheel, but I found it so
easy and so delightful to handle the ship alone that
I declined the assistance of Captain Williams, who
stood just behind me. Though I am not tall, being not
much over five feet and eight inches, nature was kind in
giving me a well set up frame and a powerful constitution,
devoid of nerves but with muscles of
steel,—in those days and for many years after,—and
with a reserve supply of strength that made me
marvel at its source. Through all of my active life
I kept myself in as perfect condition as a trained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
athlete, despite occasional dissipations ashore, and
I never got into a close corner without feeling myself
possessed of the strength of half a dozen ordinary
men. Consequently the tugs of the wheel as we tore
through the water toward Charleston seemed like a
child’s pulls on a string.</p>

<p>The widest opening in the already closing line was,
luckily, directly in front of us, and I headed for it.
The sparks that were streaming from our smokestack
and the lights of the patrol which was trying
to follow us, gave the blockaders our course as plainly
as though it had been noonday, and they closed in
from both sides to head us off. Evidently they considered
that time was also fleeting for they lost not a
moment in getting their guns to going, and shot and
shell screamed and sang all around the undaunted
“Letter B.” First the mainmast and then the foremast
came down with a crash, littering the decks with
their gear. A shell carried death into the forecastle.
One shot tore away the two forward stanchions of
the pilot house and another one smashed through the
roof but neither Captain Williams nor I was injured
by so much as a splinter. All of our boats and most of
our upper works were literally shot to pieces. That
we were not sent to the bottom on the run was no
tribute to the skill of the Yankee gunners. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
could not have been more than half awake when they
began firing on us and we were flying so fast that
it appeared to disconcert them, even after they got
their bearings. If they had taken time to depress
their guns the race would have been a short one,
but they all wanted to sink us at once, with the result
that only one shot struck us below the main deck,
and that did very little damage to the ship.</p>

<p>From first to last we must have been under that
terrific fire for half an hour but it seemed not more
than a few minutes, and it really was with something
of regret that I found the shots were falling astern,
for I had enjoyed the experience immensely. When
we got up to the dock we found that five of our men
had been killed and a dozen more or less seriously
injured. The ship had not been damaged at all so
far as speed and seaworthiness in ordinary weather
were concerned, though she looked a wreck. The
blockaders thought we were much more seriously
injured than was actually the case but their mistake
was one that could easily be pardoned. They
expected we would be laid up for a month. Consequently
when we steamed out on the fourth night,
after making only temporary repairs, they were not
looking for us and we got through their line without
much trouble. A few shots were fired at us when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
were almost clear but not one of them came aboard
and we were not pursued; they had come to have
great respect for our speed. We refitted at Turk’s
Island, where we laid up for three weeks.</p>

<p>I made two more trips to Charleston without any
very exciting experiences, though we were fired on
both times, and then sold the ship to an enterprising
Englishman who was waiting for me at Turk’s Island.
I had made a comfortable fortune with her and sold
her for more than I paid for her. She was in almost
as good condition as when I bought her, but I have
made it a rule never to overplay my luck, and I knew
I had run about as many trips with her as I could
expect to make without a change of fortune. I am
under the impression that the ship and her new owner
were captured on her next trip to Charleston, but am
not sure as to that.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>FILIBUSTERING FOR THE CUBANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HAVING succeeded as a blockade runner I was
ambitious to become a filibuster, which kindred
vocation I thought offered even greater opportunities
for adventure. Immediately after the sale of the
“Letter B,” in the latter part of 1864, I returned to
New York, in the hope that the Cespedes revolution
in Cuba would have been sprung and a Junta established
with which I could work. I found that the
revolt was still hatching and that no New York agent
had been appointed, so, for want of something better
to do, I bought from Benjamin Wood, editor of the
New York <i>News</i>, the old Franklin Avenue distillery
in Brooklyn. This venture resulted in an open
and final rupture with my family, who were virtuously
outraged to begin with because of the aid I had given
the South as a blockade runner. I left home in a rage
and swore that I would never again set foot in it or
set eyes on any member of the family, and except
for a visit to my father just before he died, not long
afterward, I have kept my vow. I was always his
favorite son, in spite of my wild love of adventure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
and the ways into which it led me, and when I got
word that he was seriously ill I went to him at once,
but I saw no one else in the house except the
servants.</p>

<p>The Franklin Avenue distillery was then the largest
in the East but it had not been in operation for several
years. I put Charles McLaughlin in charge of the
plant and set it in motion. Two or three other distilleries
were then running in Williamsburg, one of
which was owned by Oscar King. I had been in the
distillery business only a few months, during which
time the property had shown a large profit, when,
while attending a performance at the old Grand Opera
House with Andrew W. Gill, I met “Jim” Fisk, with
whom I had become acquainted in my boyhood days.
At the time I had known him he was running a gaudy
pedler’s wagon out of Boston. He was laid up for a
week by a prank which I played on him in George
Steele’s store at Ferrisburg, Vermont, but after that
we became good friends.</p>

<p>Fisk, big and loudly dressed and displaying the
airs which later helped to earn for him the sobriquet
of “Jim Jubilee Junior,” entered the theatre in company
with Jay Gould, his new friend and future partner
in the looting of the Erie and the great Gold
Conspiracy, to say nothing of many minor maraudings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
into misappropriated millions. In the dramatic
surroundings, Gould, half-dwarfed but plainly making
up in nerve and shrewdness what he lacked in stature,
with his black beard and darting eyes and his careless
attire, put me in mind of a pirate, wherein my
artistic judgment played me no trick, and, to complete
the picture, Fisk suggested himself as the little man’s
business agent. Fisk swept his eyes around the
theatre with something of a look of challenge, as
though he wondered if there were any persons there
who knew him, and, if so, how much they knew about
him. His roving gaze fell on me and he nodded and
smiled. A moment later he excused himself and came
over to talk to me, while Gould followed him with
his snapping eyes and drove them through me with a
searching inquiry which seemed to satisfy him that
I was simply an old acquaintance and harbored no
predatory plot. Their intimacy was then in its
infancy and Gould appeared to be half suspicious of
every man with whom Fisk talked.</p>

<p>No doubt it was fate that drew Fisk and me
together. He intimated, in his grandiloquent way,
that he was in a huckleberry patch where nothing but
money grew on the bushes, and asked what I was
doing that I looked so prosperous and well satisfied
with myself. I told him briefly and he asked me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
call on him the next day. I did not go to see him
but the following day he called on me at the St.
Nicholas Hotel. After we had exchanged confidences
regarding our careers he said he wanted to buy a half
interest in the distillery and asked me to put a price
on it. I told him I did not want a partner. He
insisted and said he had influence at Washington,
which he afterward proved, and that it would be valuable
to us.</p>

<p>“We will make a good team,” he said. “Here,”
and he scribbled off a check for one hundred thousand
dollars and tossed it over to me, “now we are
partners.”</p>

<p>“Not much,” I said, as I tossed it back to him.
“I am making too much money for you to get in at
that price, even if I wanted you as a partner.”</p>

<p>“All right, then,” he replied, as he wrote out
another check for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
and handed it to me, “take that. I am in half
with you now.”</p>

<p>Before I could enter another objection he stalked
out of the room and I let it go at that, for I had a
scheme in mind and figured that his influence, if it
was as powerful as he claimed, would be useful.</p>

<p>The constant and heavy increase in the tax on
spirits had forced all of the distillers except King and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
me to shut down, and when it finally reached a point
where high wines which it cost two dollars and forty
cents a gallon to produce, by the ordinary methods
and with the payment of the full tax, were selling
for one dollar and ninety cents a gallon, King
was compelled to go out of business. In the meantime
I had devised a scheme for reducing the proof
before the tax was paid and then, by a chemical process
which operated mechanically, restoring the proof
until the product was almost, if not quite, equal to
Cologne spirits. My contention was that my process
improved the quality of the spirits, which it assuredly
did, but the effect of it was that I and not the Government
received the full benefit of the change. By Fisk’s
advice I engaged Robert Corwin, of Dayton, Ohio,
a cousin of the great “Tom” Corwin, and an intimate
friend of high officials in the Treasury Department,
whose names it is not necessary to mention at
this late date, to secure a patent on my process.
While the application was pending I was given permission
to use my process, the result being that
I could operate at a good profit, while the other
distillers could not run except at a heavy loss. We
were, as a matter of fact, cheating the Government,
and I have since thought that it probably was Fisk’s
influence rather than any merit in my invention that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
made it smooth sailing for us, but I did not then look
at it in that light. I considered that I was a very
clever young man and that I was rightfully entitled
to profit by my shrewdness, without any regard to
the rights of the Government, or to what rival concerns
might think about it.</p>

<p>King and the other distillers, convinced that there
was something wrong somewhere, tried repeatedly
but in vain to discover our method of operation.
Then they complained to Washington and one
revenue officer after another came over to investigate
us. During the progress of these protests, which
in the course of a year or more increased in number
and vigor, the revolt in Cuba had broken out and the
old sea lust, with its passion for excitement, came
over me. I wanted Fisk to buy my interest in the
distillery but he suggested that we quit business and
we did so, with a profit of about three hundred and
fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Fisk and I continued in partnership and in the
Summer of 1866 we bought the fast and stanch little
steamer “Edgar Stuart,” which had been a blockade
runner. We bought a cargo of arms and ammunition,
consisting of old Sharps rifles and six mountain
guns, and were just putting it on board when
the first Cuban Junta came to New York and opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
offices on New Street. They sent for me and wanted
to buy our cargo and pay for it in bonds of the Cuban
Republic, at a big discount. I refused, as we insisted
on gold or its equivalent, which has always been my
rule in dealing in contraband. They finally arranged
that we should be paid part in cash, on the delivery
of the arms, and the balance in fine Havana cigars.
The Spaniards were not as watchful then as they
found it necessary to be later on and the arms were
delivered without much trouble at Cape Maysi, at
the extreme eastern end of Cuba. On our return the
cigars we had received in part payment, in waterproof
cases and attached to floats, were thrown overboard
in the lower bay, to be picked up by waiting
small boats and sold to a tobacco merchant who had
a store in the old Stevens House.</p>

<p>By the time we got back the Junta had raised funds
from some source and engaged us to deliver several
cargoes of arms to the rebels. I was always in command
of these expeditions, with a sailing master in
charge of the ship, while, in keeping with our agreement,
Fisk stayed at home and attended to the Washington
end of the business. When we sailed without
clearance papers, as we sometimes were compelled
to do to avoid detention and arrest, for we were constantly
under suspicion, Fisk exerted his influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
with such good effect that we never were prosecuted.
We made three or four trips to Cape Maysi, and on
one occasion took one hundred women and children
from there to Cape San Antonio, at the western end
of the island, where the rebels were better able to
protect them.</p>

<p>In furtherance of their efforts to establish a government
and make such a formidable showing as
would secure their recognition, especially by the
United States, as belligerents, thus making it legal
to sell them munitions of war, the revolutionists
attempted to build up a navy. Through the Junta
they bought the fore and aft schooner “Pioneer,”
which was fitted out as a warship and placed in command
of Francis Lay Norton, who was given the rank
of Admiral of the Cuban Navy. He sailed up through
Long Island Sound and out past Montauk Point,
where he hoisted the Cuban flag, saluted it, and
gravely declared the “Pioneer” in commission. He
neglected to wait until he was well out on the high
seas before going through with this formality and a
revenue cutter which had followed him seized his
ship and brought it dismally back to port as a filibuster.
I did not then know Norton but we afterward
became partners and fought side by side
through adventures and exploits more thrilling than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
any that have ever been told about in fiction, so far
as I have read. Without knowing him I had great
respect for his nerve but not much for his discretion,
as displayed in the “Pioneer” incident, and the intimate
association of later years did not change my
opinion of him except to increase my admiration for
his superb daring.</p>

<p>One night I received a hurry call from the Junta.
The “Stuart” was then partly loaded with a fresh
supply of arms and was waiting for the rest of the
shipment, coming from Bridgeport, Connecticut.
The Cubans had been tipped off from Washington
that she was to be seized the next day on suspicion
of filibustering, which could have been proved easily,
and they asked me to take her out that night and
call at Baltimore for the rest of the cargo, which
would be shipped there direct from Bridgeport.
Greatly pleased by this evidence of increased Spanish
activity against us and the prospect of some exciting
times, I went to the ship without returning to
my hotel and we got under way soon after midnight,
though with a short crew. At daylight I hove to and
repainted and rechristened the ship and presented
her with a new set of papers, making it appear that
she belonged to William Shannon of Barbadoes and
was taking on supplies, including some arms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
course, for West Indian planters. We loafed along
and the balance of the cargo, which had been sent to
Baltimore by express, was waiting for us when we
got there. We hustled it on board and were just preparing
to sail when the ship was seized by the United
States Marshal, under orders from Washington.</p>

<p>“Why, Captain, your new coat of paint isn’t dry
yet,” said the marshal. “That ship was the ‘Edgar
Stuart’ when you left New York, all right enough.”
I protested that I was sailing under the British flag
but he only smiled and, naturally, I did not appeal to
the British consul for protection. There were fraternal
reasons why the marshal and I could talk confidentially,
and, though he had no right to do it, he
told me that he expected to have a warrant for my
arrest in the morning. That made it serious business
for me, as I had no desire to become entangled with
the authorities even though I had full confidence in
Fisk’s ability to get me out of trouble, and I determined
to get away, and take my ship with me.</p>

<p>The marshal left three watchmen on the ship to
guarantee her continued presence. Edward Coffee, my
steward, was a man who knew every angle of his
business. Soon after dark he served the watchers
with a lunch and followed it with a bottle of wine
which had been carefully prepared, though no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
could have told it had been tampered with. In ten
minutes they were asleep and in twice that time
we were out in the stream and headed south. We
cleared the Virginia capes at daylight, aroused
the surprised guards and loaned them a boat in which
they rowed ashore. There was no government ship
in those waters that could catch us so we proceeded
on our course without any misgivings, leaving it to
Fisk to straighten matters out. We delivered the
cargo about sixty miles west of Cape Maysi and then
went to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where I wired to Fisk
to ascertain the lay of the land. He replied that he
had “squared” things with the authorities and it
was safe for me to return but that it would be best
to leave the ship at Halifax for a while. I accordingly
took the train for New York and in two or three
weeks Captain Williams followed with the “Stuart,”
which had been restored to her real self, though
painted a different color than when she left New
York.</p>

<p>Our expeditions with the “Stuart” had been so
successful that the Spanish Government, through its
minister at Washington, had arranged with the Delamater
Iron Works, on the Hudson, for the purchase
of several small gunboats, each carrying two guns,
which were to operate against filibusters. We had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
not lost a single cargo, either while operating with
the Junta or independently of it. In some instances
the Spanish cavalry swooped down and captured part
of the shipment before the rebels could get all of it
back into the bush, but that was in no sense our fault.
Fisk had learned the terms of the Spanish minister’s
contract with the Delamater Company and the date
that was specified for the delivery of the gunboats,
but we did not know of a secret and verbal understanding
by which they were to be delivered several
weeks in advance of that time. The result was that
on my next, and last, trip to Cuba I ran full tilt into
one of the new boats, as I was not looking for them.</p>

<p>We raised Cape Maysi late in the afternoon and
were close inshore and not far from the lighthouse
when a little steamer came racing up on our starboard
bow. I saw that she was flying the Spanish
flag but that meant nothing in those waters and I
paid no attention to her, as she was nothing like the
ordinary Spanish type of gunboat, for which I was
on the lookout. She steamed up to windward of us
and I opened my eyes when she fired a blank shot
across our bows, as a signal to heave to. I promptly
ran up the British flag and kept on my course, whereupon
she sent a solid shot just ahead of us. Then I
hove to and a lieutenant and boat’s crew came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
aboard. It looked like a bad case. While the lieutenant
was being rowed to the “Stuart” I had a lot
of black powder stored under the break of the poop,
just below my cabin, and laid a fuse to it. I did this
primarily for the purpose of running a strong bluff
on the Spaniards, but I had made up my mind that if
it came to the worst I would blow up my ship and
take a long chance on getting ashore in the small
boats. I figured that the commander of the gunboat
would stop to pick up those of his crew who were sent
skyward by the explosion and that this would allow
sufficient time for some of us, at least, to escape,
which was much better than to sit still and have
all hands captured and executed.</p>

<p>When the lieutenant came aboard he called for
my papers and I gave him the usual forged set, which
indicated British registry and concealed the nature
of the cargo. He was not satisfied and ordered me
to open the hatches, which I refused to do. He procured
some tools and was having his men open them
when I gave the signal to lower the boats quickly,
and man them. The Spaniards looked on in wonder
but interposed no objection to our hurried departure.
Then I ostentatiously lit the fuse in my cabin and as
I was getting into my boat I said to the lieutenant:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
“I wish you luck in going over my cargo. You’ll
be in hell in just about three minutes.”</p>

<p>Without asking a question or saying a word the
young officer bundled his men and himself into his
boat and I lost as little time in hustling my men back
onto the “Stuart” and pulling out the fuse, which
was a long one, as I had a notion things might turn
out just as they did. Had he not flown into a state
of panic, which is characteristic of the Latin races,
the lieutenant could have pulled out the sputtering
fuse, just as I did, and removed the danger, at the
same time putting the rest of us in a bad way; but
it seemed that such an idea never occurred to him.
It was simply a case of matching American nerve
against Spanish blood, and I won. The gunboat was
half a mile to windward and a choppy sea was running
so the lieutenant had his hands full managing
his boat and had no time to try to make any signals.
I ordered full speed ahead and ran across the gunboat’s
bows, dipping our ensign as we passed. The
commander of the gunboat, thinking everything was
all right, returned our salute and dropped down to
pick up the lieutenant. When he got to the small
boat and discovered the trick that had been played
on him he sent a shot after us, which went a mile
away, and gave chase, but it was no use. It was getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
dusk by that time and in fifteen minutes it was
dark, for there is no twilight in the tropics. I swung
around in a wide circle, picked up a little inlet near
Gonaives Bay in which the rebels were waiting, and
had my cargo unloaded and was headed back for New
York before daylight.</p>

<p>Some of the filibustering trips were made at long
intervals, on account of the difficulties encountered
by the Junta in raising funds, and between two of
them, in 1867, I went to Washington, at the invitation
of Leonard Swett, of Chicago, and Dr. Fowler,
of Springfield, Illinois, and was introduced by them to
President Johnson. Swett and Fowler were trying
to line up Illinois for Johnson, and Fisk thought it
might strengthen his hand in Washington to have
me meet the President and offer to assist him in
any way I could. A few days later the President
sent for me and asked me to become his confidential
political agent. He frankly said he doubted
the accuracy of reports which had been made to him
regarding the feeling in the Middle West toward his
nomination for the presidency, and he wanted me to
visit that section and advise him as to the real sentiment,
with particular reference to Illinois. I accepted,
being flattered, I presume, by the idea of being in
confidential relations with a President. To give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
me a standing and clothe me with an air of mystery
he appointed me acting chief of the Secret Service,
from which he had removed General W. P. Wood.
“Andy” was careful to explain, however, that my
appointment was not to be announced or generally
known for the time being and that he did not want
me to bother about the ordinary operations of the
Secret Service Bureau, which were in charge of
Colonel L. C. Whitely, later appointed chief. Within
two months I reported to the President that
his friends had flattered him, that he did not have a
chance of carrying Illinois, and that sentiment was
running strongly against him throughout the West.
The insight I thus gained into politics quickly convinced
me that it was too dishonorable and not exciting
enough for me, so I resigned and went back to
filibustering.</p>

<p>If Johnson had ever had a chance of being nominated
to succeed himself in the place of power to
which he was elevated by the murder of Lincoln, it
would have been destroyed by his “swing around
the circle,” when he went to Chicago, in 1866, to
attend a cornerstone laying in honor of Stephen A.
Douglas. During the trip he quarrelled violently
with every one who disagreed with his reconstruction
policy and descended, in his speeches, to the level of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the ward heeler. I never was paid for this secret service
work, nor for the expenses I incurred, and my
failure to receive vouchers for my salary made it
apparent to me that my appointment had not been a
formal one. The experience was interesting, however,
as a temporary diversion, and I was satisfied
to regard it as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for favors Fisk and I
had received from the Administration, and which we
might expect to continue to receive, and let it go at
that. I have no doubt that Mr. Johnson looked at the
matter in the same light.</p>

<p>While the “Stuart” was laid up for repairs at one
time, during the Cuban expeditions, Capt. Williams
and I took the famous “Virginius” out on her first
trip, with a cargo of arms from the Junta. The Junta
wanted me to keep her but I refused, on account of
her size. She was larger than the “Stuart” but no
faster, and had quarters for a considerable number of
men outside of her crew, which the “Stuart” had not.
I foresaw that they would want to use her in transporting
men, and to put her into that service would
greatly increase the risk of her capture. The ideal
vessel for filibustering purposes is a small, stout ship
of light draft and high speed, without room, to say
nothing of accommodations, for passengers. A large
hold is not required, for a mighty valuable cargo of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
arms can be stowed away in a comparatively small
space. The man in command of a filibustering expedition
must be prepared for any emergency and needs
to have his wits about him every minute. If he is to
succeed he cannot think about anything except his
cargo and its delivery; he cannot afford to have any
men hanging onto his coat and dividing and diverting
his attention. Transporting troops is a very different
business from carrying arms, and my experience has
convinced me that the two cannot well be combined
on one ship.</p>

<p>Carrying contraband is dangerous business under
the most favorable conditions. The hand of every
nation is raised against you; though you be an
American the flag of your own country, even, can
give you no protection, for you are engaged in an
illegal act, however much it may stand for the
advancement of humanity and the spread of liberty.
Save for those with whom you are allied, and who
necessarily are few in number, else they would be
recognized as belligerents and given the rights of
war, any one who happens along the sea’s highway
is liable to take a shot at you or try to capture you,
on general principles. Therefore the commander of
a filibustering expedition must regard desperate
chances as a part of the daily routine, but he is unwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
to add to his risks by complicating his mission. He
must, too, be in the business chiefly for the love of the
adventure it provides as royal payment, for the financial
returns, except in cases out of the ordinary, are
as nothing compared with the dangers that are
encountered.</p>

<p>Just as I had expected, the “Virginius” after many
narrow escapes was finally captured by the Spaniards
on October 31, 1873, as she was about to land a mixed
cargo of men and arms near Santiago. General
Cespedes, the life of the revolution, and three of his
best fighting chiefs, Generals Ryan, Varona, and Del
Sal, who happened to be on board, were summarily
executed. This was done, it was claimed, under prior
sentences, but as a matter of fact there was not so
much as a mockery of a trial, either at the time
they were put to death or previously. All of the
others who were on board were tried for piracy and
promptly convicted, of course. Within a week after
the seizure of the ship, Capt. Joseph Fry, her American
commander, thirty-six of his crew, and sixteen
“passengers,” were lined up and shot to death, with
an excess of brutality. The rest of the prisoners, who
were to have been similarly disposed of, were saved,
not through intervention from Washington whence
it should have come, but by the timely arrival of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
British warship, whose commander refused to permit
any further butchery. England peremptorily compelled
the Spanish Government to pay a substantial
indemnity for the British subjects who had been thus
lawlessly executed, while the United States Government,
as an evidence of the protection it gave American
citizens in those days, waited twenty-five years
before taking vengeance on Spain for the murder of
Captain Fry and his companions. But for the “Virginius”
Massacre and the bad blood it engendered
between America and Spain, Cuba might still be taking
orders from Madrid instead of from Washington;
had it not been for that never forgotten butchery the
blowing up of the “Maine” might have been regarded
as an accident.</p>

<p>Along about 1868, after it had run half its length,
the Ten Years’ War began to bog down. The Cubans
were out of funds and appeared to have lost heart,
and it looked as though the revolt would be another
failure. There was nothing else doing in this part of
the world in which I was interested so I decided to
go to Europe, being attracted by the prospect of war
between France and Germany and the adventurous
possibilities which it suggested.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>IN LEAGUE WITH THE SPANISH PRETENDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING the Cuban filibustering days I gained
more notoriety than I desired, even though it
really was not a great deal, and as I did not wish to
be known as a trouble-maker on the other side, where
the laws against the carrying of contraband were
being rigidly enforced on account of the recent “Alabama”
affair, I lost my identity while crossing the
Atlantic. When I reached London in the latter part
of 1868 I was “George MacFarlane,” and in order
that I might have an address and ostensible occupation
I established the commercial house of George
MacFarlane &amp; Co., at 10 Corn Hill. My partner, who
really was only a clerk, was a young Englishman
named Cunningham, for whom I had been able to do
a good turn while I was living in Chicago. I opened
an account in the London &amp; Westminster Bank with
an initial deposit of close to seventy-five thousand
pounds, which gave me a financial standing.</p>

<p>In order to establish my respectability with the
British Board of Trade, which exercised a watchful
eye and general supervision over the enforcement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
the maritime laws, and to build up a reputation for
eminent business respectability which would serve
as a cover for the illicit but much more exciting
operations in which I expected to engage as soon as
opportunity offered, and at the same time to throw
me naturally in contact with shipping concerns under
the most favorable conditions, I bought several small
vessels and began shipping general cargoes to and
from the Continent, either on my own account or for
others. Fate was kind to me in throwing in my way
the little steamer “Leckwith,” which I bought at a
bargain. She had been built as a yacht for a nobleman
but did not suit him. She was not large enough
to be used as a passenger boat and her depth of hold
was not sufficient to make her profitable as a freighter,
but she was exactly the ship I wanted as a carrier of
contraband. She registered five hundred and twenty
tons and could do seventeen knots when she was
pushed. She was small enough to go anywhere, fast
enough to beat anything that was likely to chase
her, and big enough for my purposes. Until the day
I buried her, years afterward, as the only means of
destroying damning evidence, she served me faithfully
and well, and I doubt if any ship, before or
since, has made so much money for her owner.</p>

<p>One of the first shipping firms with which I became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
acquainted was that of H. Nickell &amp; Son, of Leadenhall
Street. They were speculators as well as merchants
and I cultivated them, without having to wait
long for results. Encouraged by the insurrection
against the Bourbons, which had resulted in the abdication
and flight to France of Queen Isabella, Don
Carlos, the Spanish Pretender, was just then, in 1869,
preparing to make his last fight for the long coveted
crown of Spain. His chief agent had bought all of
the arms and ammunition he could pay for from
Kynoch &amp; Co., of Birmingham, which establishment
is now, I believe, owned by Joseph Chamberlain and
his son and brother, though conducted under the old
name, and had contracted with Nickell &amp; Son for
their delivery on the northern coast of Spain. They
had lost one cargo, through the watchfulness of a
Spanish warship, and had nearly come to grief with
another, just before I became acquainted with them.</p>

<p>The Pretender’s agent then proposed that Don Carlos
pay for the arms when they were delivered, instead
of at the factory, as before, and suggested to Nickell
&amp; Son that they enter into a contract on that basis,
to cover all future purchases.</p>

<p>Old man Nickell was considering this proposition
when I met him and, suspecting that I had ideas
regarding the sailing of ships that went beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
uninteresting routine of strictly legitimate commerce,
he told me about it, after we had come to know and
understand each other a bit. Naturally, it appealed
to me and it did not take us long to reach an agreement
which, if it would not have blocked our plans
and we had wanted to follow the foolish English
fashion, would have enabled us to advertise ourselves
as “Purveyors Extraordinary of Munitions of War
to His Royal Majesty, Don Carlos.” It was agreed
that Nickell should buy the arms while I should furnish
the ship and deliver them. We were to charge
a price commensurate with the risk we assumed, with
something added,—for we had reason to believe the
Pretender had plenty of money,—and divide the
proceeds.</p>

<p>It was stipulated that the first consignment should
be delivered to Don Carlos himself at his headquarters
near Bilbao, and before accepting the cargo I went
there on an iron-ore steamer to reconnoitre. I found
that the Pretender’s retreat in the mountains back
from Bilbao was in the very heart of that section of
Spain which was most loyal to him. Carlist sentiment
was almost unanimous in the Provinces of Vizcaya,
Alava, and Guipuzcoa, and strong in the adjoining
Provinces of Navarre, Catalonia, and Aragon, so
there was nothing to fear once we succeeded in getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
up the river. Even the city of Bilbao was largely
composed of Carlist supporters, but the forts which
commanded the river there and at Portugalete, the
deep-water port of Bilbao on the coast at the mouth
of the river, were manned by unfriendly troops. The
two Generals, Prim and Serrano, who were the real
rulers of Spain and who placed Prince Amadeo, son
of the King of Italy, on the throne a year or so later,
were as much opposed to the Carlists as they had
been to the Bourbons. They did not propose that the
Pretender should gain any ground during the troubled
period which they had brought about by the expulsion
of Queen Isabella. They knew he was trying
to import arms from England and they had so many
warships patrolling the northern coast that it practically
amounted to a blockade; but, after my experience
at Charleston, I did not regard that as a
serious matter.</p>

<p>Only a small and light-draft ship could get up the
river to the point at which the arms were to be delivered,
which was a few miles above Bilbao. I did not
care to try it with the “Leckwith” so I chartered a
smaller steamer which greatly resembled the “Santa
Marta,” a Spanish coastwise ship. To avoid suspicion
as to their real destination the rifles and cartridges,
in boxes which gave no indication of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
contents, were shipped to Antwerp, and I picked them
up there. As soon as we were out of sight of land I
repainted my ship and made some slight changes in
her upper works, until she looked almost exactly like
the “Santa Marta.” That name was then painted on
her bows and the Spanish flag was hoisted over her.
With this precaution I figured that we would avoid
any trouble with the forts or any warships we might
encounter, and we did; in fact we did not see a
single warship. Of course, if we had happened to
meet the real “Santa Marta,” we would have had to
run for it at least, and it might have been more
serious than that, but I simply took a chance that
we would not run into her. We saluted the forts as
we passed them and they responded without taking
two looks at us.</p>

<p>We got over the bar at Bilbao with very little to
spare under our keel and went on up the river to the
appointed place, where we tied up so close to the
steep bank that we threw a plank ashore. A band of
gypsies—Gitanos—were camped close by, and in ten
minutes they were all over the ship. Among them
was a singularly beautiful girl to whom I was
drawn. She followed me around the ship, which did
not annoy me at all, and insisted on telling my fortune.
When I consented she told me, among a lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
other things, that I would be paid a large sum of
money in the mountains, and assassinated. Her dire
prediction did not cause me a moment’s anxiety, as
I have no faith in human ability to discern what the
inhuman Fates have prescribed for us, but she was
greatly worried by what the cards had told her and
begged me, almost with tears in her eyes, to stay
away from the mountains. As I then had no thought
of going into the hills I assured her that I would do
as she advised, whereat she was much relieved.</p>

<p>No messenger from Don Carlos came down to meet
us, as had been agreed upon, and after waiting three
or four days I sent one of the gypsies to his camp
to advise him that the cargo awaited his orders, and
the payment for it. He replied that he would send
for it and that I should come to his headquarters for
the money, as he wished to consult with me about
further shipments. He sent along one of his aides to
escort me to his camp. The Gitano girl’s warning
had made so little impression on me that I did not
recall it. It seemed natural enough that Don Carlos
should want more arms, as we had expected he would,
and that he should want to give personal directions
as to where and when they were to be delivered, and
without any thought of danger I set forth at once.
George Brown, my sailing master, a gigantic Nova<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Scotian, and Bill Heather, the second officer, accompanied
me, as they wished to see the country and,
perhaps, the famous Pretender.</p>

<p>The Carlist camp was located well up in the mountains,
nearly twelve miles from where we were tied
up. Following the aide, we walked diagonally away
from the river for about six miles, which brought us
to the foothills. Then we switched off to the left for
a mile and turned sharply to the right into a canyon,
which we followed for three miles or more when it
turned to the right again, and a two-mile tramp
landed us at the headquarters of the claimant to the
Spanish crown. The camp stretched away through
the woods that covered the plateau to which we had
climbed but we had no opportunity to inspect it, nor
to form any intelligent idea as to the number of
troops, for right at the head of the canyon was a
large square tent, surmounted with a flag bearing the
Carlist arms, which we rightly guessed was occupied
by the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>We were halted there and after a short wait I was
ceremoniously ushered into the august presence of
the Pretender. He was standing as I entered, for
impressive effect rather than from courtesy, and I
am compelled to admit that in personal appearance
he had a great advantage over any real King I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
ever seen. Perhaps forty years old, he was in the full
glory of physical manhood; six feet tall, powerfully
built, and unmistakably a Spaniard. He had a full
beard and moustache as black as his hair, large dark
eyes, a Grecian nose, and a broad high forehead
which suggested a higher degree of intellectuality
than he possessed. But his cold face was cruel and
unscrupulous and I felt—what I afterward found
was fact—that his adherents followed him chiefly
from principle and were dominated much more by
fear than by personal loyalty. Yet, despite a face forbidding
to any keen student of human nature, he was
an imposing figure, with evidences of royalty that
were exaggerated by his manner. He greeted me with
frigid formality in contradiction of the warm welcome
I had expected, as due a saviour of the Carlist
cause, and his first words, spoken in fair English,
were a curt statement that he had no money but
would pay for my cargo through his London agent
within two months.</p>

<p>Chagrined at the manner of my reception and surprised
at his attitude, I inquired, with some heat:
“How is it possible, Your Majesty, that you are not
prepared to carry out the agreement made with your
agent who was acting, as he convinced us, with your
full authority? Our contract stipulates that my cargo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
is to be paid for in cash and unless this is complied
with I cannot deliver it and we will be compelled to
accept no further orders from you.”</p>

<p>“If my agent made such a contract as that,” he
retorted with assumed indignation, “he did it on his
own responsibility alone and I refuse to be bound by
it. I have stated my terms. If you do not care to
accede to them you can go to the devil.”</p>

<p>It was plain that I would make no headway in that
direction so I went about on the other tack, using
honeyed words in place of harsh ones.</p>

<p>“I beg Your Majesty’s pardon,” I said with much
deference, “for momentarily losing my temper. It
was due to the heat and the long tramp. I am not
accustomed to such enervating exercise. I see now
that Your Majesty is joking. It could not be otherwise,
for the word of a King of Spain is sacred.”</p>

<p>The flattery went home, as I supposed, and while
he repeated that he had stated the exact situation, his
manner was more friendly.</p>

<p>“You carry the joke admirably, Your Majesty,” I
continued. “Had you not been born to rule you
would have won fame as an actor. Your mock seriousness
would, I fear, cause real seriousness at
Madrid if General Prim knew of the extent to which
you indulge your capacity for humor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>When he persisted in his assertion that he was in
earnest and did not propose to live up to the contract,
I pointed out to him, as discreetly as possible, what
the result of such a course would be. “I can only
again congratulate you on your art,” I said, “for it
would be ridiculous for me to believe you speak
seriously. Failure to keep the agreement made by
your agent even though, as I now believe, he acted
without explicit instructions from you [which I did
not believe at all] would destroy your excellent
credit, not only with my firm but with all other
dealers in revolutionary supplies, and that, of course,
is not to be thought of. On the other hand, by paying
for this cargo, in compliance with the contract,
you will establish your credit more firmly than ever,
and I have no doubt you will be able to make your
own terms for further shipments. I know that Your
Majesty is not only very honest but very wise.”</p>

<p>This argument appeared to convince him and, with
a smile as though he really had been only joking, he
summoned a venerable Jew, evidently his treasurer,
who looked like the original of all pictures of Shylock,
and, speaking so rapidly in Spanish that I could
hardly understand him, ordered him to pay me
twenty-eight thousand pounds, the amount called for
by the manifest. The Jew returned in a few minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
with the exact amount, chiefly in Spanish notes of
large denomination but with enough gold to make
quite a load. While I was waiting for the money he
told me he would want thirteen thousand more stands
of arms and a million cartridges, which were to be
shipped in two cargoes at times and places to be indicated
by his agent in London, who would arrange
the terms of payment, under specific instructions, to
avoid any further misunderstandings. I assured him
that they would be sent when and where he wanted
them. With the transaction completed Don Carlos
dramatically waved me out.</p>

<p>The officer who had piloted us to the camp suggested
that we could find our way back to the ship
without any trouble, as the trail was clearly defined,
and we started back alone. Before we had gone
twenty steps Brown asked if I had been paid in cash.
I pointed to my bulging pockets and told him I
undoubtedly had. He then confessed that he thought
we were “in for it.” Six cavalrymen, he said, had
started down the trail not long before I left Don
Carlos’ tent, and from the action attending their
movement he believed that they had been sent out to
waylay and rob and probably murder us in the deep
canyon into which the ravine from the camp turned.
In a flash I recalled the prediction of the gypsy girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
and the promise I had given her. I laughed at myself
for the spasm of something like fear that came into
my mind, yet I was undeniably nervous, for Brown
was not a man to form foolish fancies or become
unduly alarmed about anything. None of us was
armed and if Brown’s suspicion was correct, which I
was slow to believe, the troopers would make short
work of us.</p>

<p>We had turned a corner that put us out of sight of
the camp and were walking slowly along discussing,
with deep gravity on the part of Brown and Heather
and a partly assumed mock seriousness on my part,
the possibilities of the situation and the general
cussedness of Spanish character, when I saw a dark
face peering at us through the underbrush that
matted the trail on both sides. I am not sure, but I
think I jumped; anyway, I know I was startled. At
the first glance the face looked like nothing but one
of the troopers we had been talking about but in an
instant I recognized the Gitano girl who had told my
fortune and begged me not to go into the mountains.
She beckoned to us and we answered her summons,
without any unseemly haste, perhaps, but certainly
without any delay. Uttering not a word she
plunged off at right angles to the trail into deep
woods, in which we would have been hopelessly lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
in ten minutes, with the three of us following her in
Indian file. She led us over a hill and across a wide
depression and then over another much higher mountain.
There was not so much as a suggestion of a
path and it was hard going, yet none of us
complained. She brought us out to the trail at the
point where we had made our first turn into the foothills.
From there it was a straight road to the ship,
with open country all around, so there could be no
fear of ambuscade or attack.</p>

<p>The tension was relieved and the girl, with tears
in her eyes that betrayed her real emotions, threw
her arms around my neck and reproached me passionately
for violating my promise to her and
exposing myself to what she said would have been
certain death but for her intervention. It was with
difficulty that I released myself from her embrace,
while Brown and Heather discreetly and rapidly
walked on ahead of us. She said she heard where I
had gone when she went to the ship in the morning
to see me, and knowing what the plot would be, she
had taken the short-cut through the mountains, by
which we had returned, to intercept us as we were
leaving the camp. The gypsies were loyal to the
Carlists through fear of them so she could get no help
from her own people, but she had prevailed on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
brother to steal up the trail through the canyon to
see what happened there, not to verify her suspicions,
as she explained, but to prove to us that she was
right. An hour after we reached the ship her brother
returned and reported to her that six cavalrymen had
come down the ravine from the camp and concealed
themselves alongside the trail in the canyon just
below the turn. After a long wait one of them galloped
back toward the camp. He soon returned,
after discovering that we had left the trail, and the
others went back to camp with him. To Brown and
Heather that seemed convincing proof of what would
have happened to us but for the gypsy girl; my own
notion about it was that what had happened had to
happen, and I had not been killed simply because my
time had not arrived. Therefore I felt nothing of
gratitude; but when I came to analyze my real feeling
toward the young woman, whose wondrous black
eyes seemed to reflect all of the mystery and witchery
of those glorious ages that died with the departure of
the Moors, and were silently eloquent of a fine civilization
of old centuries, I found that the deep impression
her physical charms had made on me had
been intensified by her mad affection for me. This
made it no easy matter to leave her, but I had no
notion of taking her with me, and had to get bluff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Bill Heather to half carry her ashore just before the
gang plank was pulled in.</p>

<p>Most of the arms had been removed from the ship
while we were away and turned over to the guard
Don Carlos had sent down. The rest of the cargo
was jerked out with all speed and as soon as the last
box was on the bank we got under way. We had not
gone a quarter of a mile, moving slowly on account of
the tortuous channel, when the gypsies came running
after us, shouting and waving at us to come back.
The cause of their excitement was soon discovered
in the presence of my Gitano girl, who had stolen on
board at the last minute, while I was below inspecting
the engines, and concealed herself until we were under
way.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to stop the ship and set her
ashore but before I could give the order she came running
to me and declared, with an imperious air of
authority: “I am going with you, so pay no attention
to my foolish people.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear girl, you cannot do that,” I protested.
“I shall be accused of having stolen you.”</p>

<p>“You cannot steal what belongs to you,” was her
quick reply.</p>

<p>“But I am going to a strange land where there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
none of your people and where your language is a
strange tongue. You will be lonely and die.”</p>

<p>“I never shall be lonely where you are,” she
exclaimed with all the passion of her romantic soul,
“and I shall not die unless they kill me here. If you
go on I go with you; if I go ashore you go with
me.”</p>

<p>Never before having encountered such affection I
was content to let her have her way. Her tribesmen
followed us, and called down all manner of curious
curses on our heads, until they were convinced we
had no thought of stopping, when two of them galloped
on ahead of us toward Bilbao. They went to
the fort, evidently, and told the officer in command
that we were aiding Don Carlos, for as soon as we
got within hailing distance we were ordered to heave
to. We paid no attention to the command, of course,
and as the only effect of a warning gun which followed
was to increase our speed, they sent half a
dozen shots at us, as a matter of duty. One of them
shattered the fore-topmast and brought the fore-rigging
down by the run; the others went wild. We
were fired at from a height and dropping shots seldom
hit, though when they do they are generally
disastrous. With everything dragging forward, until
the gear could be cleared away, we proceeded down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
the widening river at full speed. Greatly to my surprise
we were not even hailed by the fort at the mouth
of the river, where I had looked for some serious
business, and we continued happily on our way to
London.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival there I established the
Gitano girl, to whom I had become deeply attached,
in a cottage near Chalk Farm, not far from the city.
I left her amply supplied with money and there were
other gypsies near there with whom she could fraternize.
It is an evidence of the strange way in which
my life has been ordered that I never saw her again.
When I returned, at the first opportunity, in about
two years, I found nothing but a pile of blackened
ruins where the cottage had stood. The Gitano girl’s
beauty had made her known to the people who lived
nearby but they had not seen her for more than a
year, and the neighboring gypsies had moved away, no
one knew where. I am not much given to regrets,
being content to let my destiny work itself out free
from senseless protests, yet if my wishes had been consulted
I would not have lost my glorious Gitano girl.
Possibly the ruined cottage symbolized a love that
had burned itself out or it may be that somewhere
her spirit is waiting for mine. “Why?” and “When?”
are questions that I never attempt to answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>That experience finished me with Don Carlos.
Seven or eight years later, when I was selling arms
to Montenegro and Turkey, and not long after he
had finally been driven out of Spain, I met him at
Claridge’s Hotel in London, as he came in from
attending church at the Greek Chapel. He recognized
me and, after pausing for a second, offered me
his hand, but I refused it.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he demanded angrily.</p>

<p>“I mean, Your Royal Highness,” I replied, with
some sarcasm, “that if I am here to shake hands with
you it is through no good will of yours, for you tried
to have me assassinated in your mountains.” He
looked at me hard for a moment, shrugged his shoulders,
and walked on.</p>

<p>After settling up with Nickell on the Don Carlos
expedition I devoted myself, for a few months, to
legitimate commerce. I had bachelor quarters on
Russell Square, in London, and divided my time
between that city and Paris, where I opened a branch
of my mercantile and shipping house at 30 Rue
Vivienne. While in Paris I lived at the Grand Hotel
and loafed at Charley Wells’ American restaurant
nearby on the Rue Scribe. In both London and Paris
I read and heard considerable about a picturesque
South American named Guzman Blanco. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
been driven out of Venezuela, of which country he
was Vice-President, and was said to be then planning
a revolt through which he expected to gain the presidency.
I was anxious to meet him but was unable
to do so, as both of us were moving about a great
deal. I had thought of Venezuela before I visited
Europe and, attracted by the promised revolt, I
decided that I would go to that country as soon as
the Franco-Prussian War, which then was almost
ready to break out, was over, or before that if it lasted
longer than I thought it would. Just before the war
began I bought three cargoes of wines at Bordeaux
and sent them to London, where I sold them later
at a good profit.</p>

<p>During the brief war, which began on July 19,
1870, and ended in the capitulation of the French at
Sedan on September first, I had three ships busy with
honest cargoes, but I did not get a chance to do any
contraband running until just before its close. The
Austrian Army was then being rearmed with the improved
Werndle rifle, and thousands of the old guns
were stored in the arsenal at Vienna.</p>

<p>Nickell had bought a lot of them at a bargain but
on account of the war Austria would not release them
without a guarantee that they were not to be used
against Germany. I was led to believe I could sell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
five thousand of these rifles to the Committee of
Safety at Bordeaux; so I bought that number from
Nickell and, with an order for their delivery, I went
to Trieste in the “Leckwith.” Charles Lever, the
novelist, was then the British consul at Trieste,
where he died a year or two later. On the pretence
that the arms were for Japan, and that I would be
able to establish that fact within a few days, I secured
the removal of the guns from Vienna to the Trieste
arsenal, which was only a few hundred yards from the
dock at which the “Leckwith” was tied up. However,
to get them over that short distance and then
to get away with them was a problem that puzzled
me. I was mulling over it one day in a <i>café</i> when
a maudlin young Englishman, who was sitting at the
table with me and had been trying to talk to me,
pulled out a passport, all plastered with red seals and
wax in the old Continental fashion. It was a most
formidable and ceremonious looking document and
the instant I saw it an inspiration seized me. From
the most taciturn I became the most jovial of companions
and plied the Englishman with wine until
he fell sound asleep.</p>

<p>Then I took the passport from his pocket and
hustled off to the arsenal. I had been assiduously
cultivating the officers there and was delighted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
find the young lieutenant with whom I was best
acquainted in charge of the guard. I told him I would
have the order for the release of the rifles within an
hour and proceeded to celebrate by getting him in
the same state in which I had found the convenient
Englishman. I sent word to Lorensen, sailing master
of the “Leckwith,” to get up a full head of steam, and
engaged a dozen big wagons to be at the arsenal in
an hour. I arrived with the wagons, waved the gaudy
passport in front of the young officer’s face, and without
trying to read it he told me to go ahead. We
made quick work of getting the boxed arms to the
ship and under her hatches, for the guard was changed
at four o’clock and my sleepy young friend would be
succeeded by an officer who was sober and in his
right mind. We were not quite fast enough, however,
for just as we were pulling out the new officer
of the guard came running down the dock, shouting
that he wanted to see the order for the release of the
arms. As he was well out of arm’s-reach I made a
fussy effort to hand him the passport. Then I opened
it out and showed it to him, all the while explaining
that it was all right.</p>

<p>He went away shaking his head and I anticipated
trouble at the fort at the entrance to the harbor, at
the head of the Adriatic, as the channel through which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
we had to run was narrow. The fort occupied a
commanding position and had high walls from the
water’s edge, with a free bastion high up. Sure
enough, a shot whizzed across our bows as we reached
the fort. Immediately I swung the ship in and
before they saw I was not going to come to anchor,
as they had supposed, we were so close under the
walls that they could not bring their guns to bear on
us. It was only a very few minutes, however, until
they could reach us with their seaward guns, and they
let go at us without any delay. The second shot took
a bite out of the mainmast and it looked as though
they had found our range and would smash us in a
jiffy; but the brave little ship was tearing through
the water at her top speed and, as we were going
directly away from them, was hard to hit. Shells
splashed uncomfortably close to us for a few minutes,
but save for one shot that carried away some of
the ginger-bread work on the stern we were not
struck again, and were soon out of reach of anything
like accurate fire. The “Leckwith” had stood
her first baptism of fire in a way that augured well
for her future, and the sign was a good one.</p>

<p>The arms were rushed to Bordeaux and turned
over to the Committee of Safety only a few days
before the battle of Sedan. I was sufficiently enthusiastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
in the cause of France to land them without a
proper guarantee of payment, and, in fact, they never
were paid for. Everything was turmoil; so after
waiting a few days I placed the bill for the arms with
an attorney and hurried on to London, <i>en route</i> for
Venezuela, where I expected to find more excitement,
in which hope I was in no way disappointed. I
placed the “Leckwith” and my ships in the hands of
Nickell &amp; Co., for charter, and took the first steamer
for New York.</p>

<small>LAWLESS LATIN AMERICA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE first word that reached me on my arrival in
New York near the end of September, 1870,
was that my wife was seriously ill at her old home in
Illinois. She had been on the Continent with relatives
of old man Nickell, the ship broker and contraband
dealer, during most of the time that I was
messing around with Don Carlos and the French,
and started home two months ahead of me. She had
a very bad trip, her ship having been twenty-six days
at sea, and as she was not a good sailor she suffered
severely and contracted an illness which proved fatal.
I went to her at once and remained at her side until
the end, three weeks later. Her death was a severe
blow to me. She was an exceptional woman, in that
she had much good sense, was not given to chatter,
and was a delightful companion. Though she had
never become quite reconciled to my adventurously
active life, I was devoted to her, and if she had lived I
might eventually have settled down and become a respectable
and self-respecting business man, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
class, I am bound to say, I would have had little
company.</p>

<p>When I returned to New York after the funeral I
was greatly depressed and was in a mood for anything
that offered excitement. A few days later I
found some diversion through a chance meeting with
Frank (Francis Lay) Norton, just after he had gone
broke in John Morrissey’s uptown gambling house.
He knew me, by reputation and through the old
Cuban Junta under which both of us had operated, as
well as I knew him, and we soon became friends.
Later we became partners in some of the most gloriously
exciting exploits in which I have been fortunate
enough to participate. Norton was a natural-born
pirate, and he looked the part. He was then about
forty years old, five feet, eight inches tall, thin and
wiry and possessed of remarkable strength. His
eyes, hair, beard, and moustache were as black as coal.
You could feel his eyes looking through you and
would almost lose a realizing sense of what was
in your mind; it was not hypnotism nor mental or
physical dominance but he could almost read your
most secret thoughts. He was completely irreligious,
cynical, and cold-blooded. Under the most severe
tests a slight twitching of the eyes was his only sign
of excitement. He was daring to the supreme degree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
but never foolishly reckless, and I don’t believe he
ever experienced the sensation of fear. He was, too,
as he needed to be, almost a dead shot in off-hand
firing with rifle or pistol, and an expert swordsman.</p>

<p>When I first met him he was wild about the China
Sea, where he had spent several thrilling years and
made several fortunes, only to lose them as soon as
he could find a gambling house, for he was a faro
fiend of the most virulent type. He declared that was
the only part of the world for us, with regard both
to excitement and money, and suggested that we form
a partnership and go out there “to do anything that
came handy.” Though I had spent money like the
proverbial drunken sailor, or worse, for I was born
with all the tastes of an aristocrat, I was then worth
several hundred thousand dollars, while Norton was
worth nothing, so I could not quite see a partnership
such as he had in mind. Nor was he able to tempt
me away from Venezuela. I had heard so much of
that country and of Guzman Blanco that my heart
was set on going there before I undertook to explore
any other strange lands. The upshot of our many
discussions was that I sent Norton to London to take
command of the “Leckwith” until I was ready to
join him, when it was agreed we should go out in the
yacht to his beloved China Sea. I had brought Lars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Lorensen, the former sailing master of the “Leckwith”
and a brave and loyal Norseman, with me from
the other side, as I expected to have need of him in
South America.</p>

<p>After Norton’s departure I bought the fore and aft
schooner yacht “Juliette,” about eighty tons, fitted
her out at New London, Connecticut, for a six
months’ cruise, and with Lorensen as sailing master,
started for Bermuda to test her seaworthiness. We
reached there in five days and proceeded to St.
Thomas, where I hoped to find Guzman Blanco. He
was not there so we went on to Curacoa, which was
then, as it has been ever since, a revolutionary
rendezvous. We arrived there in the latter part of
December. I found that Guzman was there, and
James Faxon, the American consul, introduced me to
him at the Willemstad Club, where he was playing
billiards with Gen. Pulgar, his chief-of-staff. Before
meeting him I had familiarized myself with recent
Venezuelan history, as far as it concerned him. I
learned that Guzman Blanco’s father, Dr. Antonio
Guzman, began political life as private secretary to
Simon Bolivar, the famous “Liberator,” and had been
prominent in Venezuelan politics for fifty years. He
aided in the election of Jose Tadeo Monagas to the
presidency and at his request his son, Guzman Blanco,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
was appointed Secretary of Legation at Washington,
where he lived during 1856 and 1857. In the latter
year Dr. Guzman had a row with Monagas and was
expelled from the country. He went to St. Thomas
and was soon joined by his son. There they met Gen.
Falcon, who too had been banished by Monagas and
was planning a revolt. When Falcon invaded Venezuela
in 1859, in what became known as the “Five
Years’ War,” Guzman Blanco went with him. In a
succession of brilliant victories young Guzman
demonstrated his great bravery and military genius
and he soon was at the head of a division, later becoming
second in command. Falcon entered Caracas
in triumph in April, 1863, after devastating most of
the country, and was elected President, with Guzman
Blanco as Vice-President. In addition to this title
Guzman was made Minister of Finance and of Foreign
Relations, and in 1864, and again in 1867, he
went to Europe to settle the national debt and
arrange a new loan. While he was away the second
time the old Monagas faction came back to life with
enough strength to force Falcon to abandon Caracas,
and when Guzman returned from London in 1868 a
mob surrounded his house and stoned it. He fled to
Europe. He had just returned and was planning an
invasion of Venezuela when I met him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>I told him of my efforts the year before to meet
him in London and Paris and their purpose; that I
was running contraband, more to satisfy my love of
adventure than as a business, and I believed I could
be useful to him; that South America was prolific of
revolutions and I was ambitious to have a hand in
them. After he had studied me, asked all sorts of
questions, and apparently satisfied himself that I
could be relied on, Guzman told me, in a general way,
of his plans and asked me to secure for him three
thousand old Remington rifles and five hundred
thousand cartridges and deliver them as quickly as
possible at Curacoa. We sailed for New York the
day after the order was given, early in January, and
made the trip in just a month. I bought the arms
from P. D. Orvis &amp; Co., of Whitehall Street, and we
were on our way back within a week. We made the
return trip in twenty-eight days and reached Curacoa
just before the sunset gun was fired. The entrance to
the harbor at Curacoa is very narrow and in those
days it was, and I believe still is, closed during the
night by a great chain, which was raised at sunset
and lowered at sunrise by a powerful windlass.</p>

<p>I went ashore at once and to the club where, instead
of Guzman Blanco, whom I expected would be
waiting for me, I found Gen. Ortega, who was with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Guzman when I first met him and seemed to be fully
in his confidence. Ortega handed me a note, bearing
what purported to be the signature of Guzman, which
directed me to deliver the cargo at a place to be indicated
by Ortega, and stated that payment for it would
be made on my cabin table. As I was not familiar
with Guzman’s writing I showed the signature to
Dr. Leon and to old man Jesurun, who owned the
shipyard, who knew Guzman well, and both of them
pronounced it genuine. I had no suspicion that anything
was wrong and took this precaution simply as
a matter of ordinary business sense. Ortega directed
me to deliver the cargo at Tucacas Point, a little
peninsula about one hundred miles west of La Guaira,
and said we must put to sea that night, as Guzman
was anxiously awaiting the arms. Through exceptional
representations of some sort to the commandante
he secured the lowering of the chain, and
we left at once, arriving off the point the next
evening.</p>

<p>Ortega went ashore and returned with a request
that I order off the hatches and start the unloading
of the cargo in my boats and then go ashore with
him and get my money. This was not in accord with
my contract with Guzman or with the note Ortega
had handed me, but, though I was reminded of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
experiences with Don Carlos, I had great confidence
in Guzman and did not wish to offend him, so I readily
consented to the amended arrangement. As soon
as the unloading was well under way I went ashore
with Ortega. We climbed the bluff and walked half a
mile inland to a mud-thatched hut before which a
sentry was pacing. Ortega gave the countersign and
we stepped inside, to find Gen. Pulgar, who was chief-of-staff
for Guzman when I was introduced to him at
the Willemstad Club, wrapped in a <i>chinchora</i> and
smoking in a hammock. After shaking hands with
him I asked where Guzman was. He replied
evasively that he was there instead of Guzman. I
told him briefly about my trip, in response to his
queries, and then asked him for my money, which
Ortega had said was waiting for me. Pulgar smiled
and straightened up.</p>

<p>“I told Ortega to deliver that message to you,”
he said, “but there is no use mincing words and I
may as well tell you that you are my prisoner. Your
cargo is being taken care of and will be put to a very
different purpose from that which you expected. As
I have said, you are my prisoner but I have an offer
to make you which, if you accept it, will be to your
advantage. Guzman is not an old friend of yours and
if you make a profit on your arms it can’t make much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
difference to you whether you serve him or me. If
you will join my forces, of your own free will, I will
make you a colonel and give you command of a battalion
and when the revolution is over I will pay you
for your rifles, just as Guzman agreed to do.”</p>

<p>“You seem to forget,” I replied, “that I have a
contract with Gen. Guzman which, as an honorable
man, I can’t go back on.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t appear to be in a very good position
just now to carry it out, do you?” he asked.</p>

<p>I again inquired where Guzman was but a shrug of
the shoulders was the only answer I could get to
questions along that line. Not knowing as much
about Venezuelan revolutions then as I did later I
could not fathom this strange situation to my entire
satisfaction, but it was my guess that in some way
Pulgar had become arrayed against Guzman, and it
turned out that I was right.</p>

<p>I told Pulgar that I would give him an answer at
gunfire, in the morning, and spent the night with
Ortega, under guard. I tried to draw him out but,
evidently according to orders, he would not even talk
about the weather.</p>

<p>At sunrise we went to see Pulgar. When asked
for my decision I inquired what the result would be
if his revolution failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Then I am sorry, my dear Captain, but you will
lose your cargo, while I will lose my life, which is of
infinitely more importance to me. But the revolution
will not fail,” he vehemently declared.</p>

<p>As though impressed by his confidence in himself,
I announced that I would take a chance with him and
accept his offer, with a mental reservation to escape
at the first opportunity, for I did not propose to fight
against Guzman, and that, I was convinced, was what
it amounted to.</p>

<p>“That is excellent,” he said, with the suggestion
of a bow. After coffee I went with him to inspect his
troops. He had about three thousand men, many of
whom were already armed with the rifles I had
brought in, and they were strung across the narrow
arm of the peninsula in a line almost as ragged as
their clothes. I was formally given command of a
battalion of three hundred men, and an Indian servant,—I
afterward found he had orders to shoot me if
I attempted to escape,—was assigned to me. I accompanied
Pulgar back to his headquarters, where I
was given an old sword and the tarnished shoulder
straps of a colonel, these constituting my uniform.</p>

<p>“Now that you have allied yourself with my
forces,” he then said, “you will have no use for your
ship, for the present at least. She is still lying in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
bay and if she remains there she is likely to be captured
or cause trouble. You will therefore write a
note to the officer in charge of her directing him to
proceed to Curacoa and await orders. She will be
safe there and,” with a quizzical smile, “you will be
safe here. We have no boats but we will signal your
ship from the beach that we have word for it.”</p>

<p>I had been expecting this command and, as there
was nothing else for me to do, I complied with it at
once. It was cutting off my only hope of rescue,
though a forlorn one as I was forced to admit, but the
adventure which the situation promised to develop
was getting into my blood and, to tell the truth, I
rather liked the idea of being left to my own resources
amid such strange surroundings. Pulgar had told
me during the inspection of his camp that we would
probably soon be in action, as “some” troops were
advancing on him, and if they did not attack him
before he was ready to march, he would go out to
meet them. He preferred that they should bring the
fight to him for all of his men were recruited from that
section and knew every foot of the country. When I
came to know Venezuela I appreciated that Pulgar
required no great prestige to gain a considerable following
in that part of the country, for it was a veritable
hotbed of revolution, ranking with Maturin in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the east and Barquisimeto in the southwest,—three
kegs of powder that could be set off by almost any
man who had two legs and a sword.</p>

<p>I started in to drill my troops with the idea of making
them a really effective fighting force, but it was
the most difficult task I had ever undertaken. They
were lazy to a degree that passes the understanding
of an Anglo-Saxon and they had not the slightest
desire to learn even the first principles of the science
of war, as it is understood outside of South America.
I had been trying to whip them, and others, into some
sort of shape for about a week when word was
brought in one morning that the enemy was approaching.
We had no advance guard out, though I had
tried to induce Pulgar to post one, and a few minutes
after the scouts had been driven in the action became
general, with the forces apparently about evenly
matched in numbers. Instead of allowing me to lead
my battalion, Pulgar ordered me to remain with him
on a little knoll in the rear, from which he made a
pretence of directing his forces. He could have accomplished
much more in front, for what his men
needed was a leader, not a director. They were fighting
in Indian fashion, with every man shooting
indiscriminately from behind a tree or log, and they
paid no attention to commands. I will say for them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
though, that they fought hard and stubbornly, but
they were gradually driven back, and Pulgar, who had
a terrible temper, was furious. All at once the opposing
troops were largely reinforced and came with a
rush which quickly converted our orderly retreat into
a rout. Pulgar, cursing like a madman, dashed madly
into the disorganized mass of his liberty-loving louts,
with Ortega and the rest of his staff at his heels.</p>

<p>I was left alone and was hesitating as to what I
should do when my Indian servant tugged at my
trousers leg. “Follow me, Colonel,” he said, “I know
where there is a boat.” He started off at the run
and covered ground so fast that I had to gallop my
horse to keep up with him. He led the way to the
beach near where my cargo had been landed and
pushed a native boat from under a clump of mangrove
trees. We jumped in and shoved off in a hurry, for
Ortega and several of his men had just appeared on
the bluff above us and were making for us. There
were no oars in the boat but we pulled a board loose
from the bottom and used it as a paddle. A strong
current from the east swept us clear of the peninsula
and out to sea; but I was not alarmed, for I figured
that we would soon be in the path of coasting vessels.
Scattered rifle patter reached us for a long time, indicating
that my former comrades-in-arms were being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
ignominiously chased around in a way that must have
been most discouraging to Pulgar. Toward the
middle of the afternoon, as we were trying to work
in toward the land, the Indian let our paddle get away
from him, which left us entirely at the mercy of the
elements, and I suspected that we might have fared
better if we had stayed on shore.</p>

<p>We drifted around for three days and nights without
so much as a glimpse of a distant sail, and without
an ounce of food or a mouthful of water, save
only such as we were able to suck out of our clothes
during and after a providential rain that fell on the
second night. On the morning of the fourth day a
fog lifted and close to us was a fleet of fishermen
from the island of Oruba, twenty miles to the westward
of Curacoa. They took us to their island and
after we had rested and eaten for two days a fishing
boat took us to Curacoa. There I learned from
Consul Faxon what had happened in Venezuela.
Guzman’s plans had worked out more rapidly than
he anticipated when he sent me to New York for
arms, and he landed in Venezuela early in February
at the head of a small force but with a large army
waiting for him. The old Liberals flocked to his
standard and with only slight resistance he entered
Caracas and proclaimed himself Dictator. His victory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
was so easily achieved and was so largely a personal
one that he did not give to Pulgar the reward to
which that general considered himself entitled, and the
latter immediately started a new revolution.</p>

<p>When I told Faxon the manner in which I had
been imposed on and how I had been impressed into
Pulgar’s service, he advised me to go to Caracas at
once and tell President Guzman the whole story.
Though somewhat dubious as to the result, because
of the fear that Guzman would be skeptical, and perhaps
brutal, I followed his advice and went on the
next steamer. The same ship carried a letter to Guzman
from Faxon in which he told him of my experiences
and of the precautions I had taken to verify the
signature to the order Ortega had given me on my
arrival with the arms. From the effect which this
letter produced I judge that Faxon also said some
very complimentary things about me, but I never had
an opportunity to thank him, for he died before I was
in Curacoa again.</p>

<p>I called on Guzman after I knew he had received
Faxon’s letter, and was welcomed with marked cordiality.
“Tell me your whole story,” he said, “but
let me assure you, it is believed before it is told.”
His face took on an ugly look when I told him how
Ortega had tricked me with the forged order and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
interrupted me to say that he had sent an officer to
Curacoa to await the “Juliette” and direct me to
deliver the arms at La Guaira. This officer’s failure
to get to me in advance of Ortega had not been satisfactorily
explained and had, Guzman said, been
severely punished. It was evident that he suspected
collusion between his agent and Ortega.</p>

<p>When I had finished Guzman told me he was surrounded
by men whom he either suspected or
hesitated to trust. He wanted a man whom he could
rely on implicitly to watch for evidences of treachery
among those around him, and he was kind enough to
say he thought me the man for whom he had been
looking. He asked me to remain in Caracas for an indefinite
time, to mix freely with his <i>entourage</i> and
become intimately acquainted with them and ascertain
who could be trusted and who were doubtful. I
could pose as an American who was studying the
country with the idea of making investments, which
would explain my interest in things and my desire to
cultivate the members of his court. I spoke Spanish
well and could also converse easily enough in French,
though that language was little used except among
the diplomats.</p>

<p>I accepted his invitation gladly and a part of the
time that I was in Caracas I spent at the Yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
House, the residence of the President, as his guest.
Guzman was the handsomest man I have ever known;
tall and as straight as a sword, with long black beard
and dark eyes, sharp as needles, that could flash fire
or friendship. He was magnetic and winning to the
last degree and every inch a ruler of men, without
the faintest notion as to what fear meant. During
the nearly twenty years that he was absolute ruler
of Venezuela his temper was the thing most dreaded
through all the land. I have seen grizzled generals,
descended from the best families of old Spain, turn
almost white at the sign of his anger.</p>

<p>Himself a pure Castiliano, he regarded the native
Venezuelanos as a vastly inferior race, thereby furnishing
another illustration of his good judgment,
and there was much of contempt in his attitude
toward them. Many times, when they had incurred
his displeasure by a display of cowardice or some
other fault, I have heard him abuse a quailing crowd
of the highest officers in the Venezuelan Army in language
much more vigorous and profane than an
American policeman would use to a gang of hoodlums.
“You are not worth a damn,” he would always
tell them in conclusion, “except in proportion to the
amount of foreign blood that is in you.” Yet until
the day when he was treacherously overthrown, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the great loss of Venezuela, no criticism of his was
ever resented nor was there ever a whisper of protest.
The people knew their master.</p>

<p>One of the first whom Guzman asked me closely to
observe was a young Indian officer named Joachim
Crespo, an aide attached to his household. I reported
that he could be implicitly trusted, and knowledge of
that fact helped me out of a scrape years later, when
Crespo was President of Venezuela.</p>

<p>Not more than ten days after my arrival in Caracas
Guzman asked me to be in his private <i>sala</i> at ten
o’clock the next morning, to meet an old friend. At
the appointed hour the Governor of the Casa Publica
came in, with a few officers, escorting none other than
Gen. Vicento Pulgar, who had put to his service my
cargo of arms. Pulgar was in full uniform and bore
himself like a hero. His manner was almost contemptuous
and his expression was one of amused curiosity
rather than fear.</p>

<p>Guzman made him a courtly bow and extended his
hand, which Pulgar reluctantly accepted.</p>

<p>“This is an unexpected pleasure,” Guzman said.</p>

<p>“I dare say it is to you, General, but here I am, at
your service.”</p>

<p>“I hope you are here as a friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Whatever General Guzman desires must necessarily
be accepted as an accomplished fact.”</p>

<p>Guzman turned to the Governor and asked him the
occasion for the call. The Governor replied that they
had brought General Pulgar as a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>“Prisoner!” exclaimed Guzman with profound
astonishment. “My friend General Pulgar a prisoner!
If that is the purpose of your visit you may
retire.”</p>

<p>After the officers had departed Guzman turned to
Pulgar with a more serious air. “You will be my
guest in Caracas until such time as I need you elsewhere,”
he said. “I will be pleased to receive a call
from you every day.”</p>

<p>Pulgar bowed; no other parole was necessary.</p>

<p>That was Guzman’s way of doing things and it was
well understood, especially by men of intellect like
Pulgar. No firmer hand than Guzman’s ever ruled
but it was ordinarily encased in a velvet glove. His
bare hand, which was displayed only when extreme
conditions demanded, was a sign of terror.</p>

<p>As Pulgar was leaving he stopped and congratulated
me on my safe trip to Caracas. I thanked
him, with the same politeness. Neither of us alluded
to his seizure of my arms or to my enforced service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
with him. Pulgar and I subsequently became good
friends.</p>

<p>I congratulated Guzman on his diplomacy and his
shrewd effort to turn a powerful enemy into a useful
friend, though I doubted if he would succeed.</p>

<p>“If I and my good adviser, Captain Boynton, cannot
pull the claws of the General, we will have to take
the consequences,” he said. From that I understood
that I was to keep close watch of Pulgar and report
daily, which I did. Everything that I saw and heard
indicated that Guzman’s diplomacy would fail.
Pulgar told his friends openly that while Guzman
seemed very friendly he was not deceived and would
kill him at the first opportunity. “Well, he’ll have
plenty of opportunity,” said Guzman with a laugh
when I reported this to him.</p>

<p>There was a reception at the Yellow House a few
nights later. Pulgar was invited and was present.
Guzman soon found an opportunity to engage him in
conversation. “I have already found that being
President of Venezuela has its objectionable features,”
sighed Guzman after they had chatted
lightly for a few minutes. “One has to listen
to so many ridiculous tales. For instance, I have
heard many foolish stories about you, one of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
being an alleged threat to kill me the first time you
have a chance.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about the others, but I did say
that,” replied Pulgar.</p>

<p>Guzman shrugged his shoulders, as though wearied.
“How often,” he responded, “we say we are going to
do things which we may think we will do but which
we never do do.”</p>

<p>“When I get an opportunity that a gentleman
can take advantage of, I intend to kill you, General
Guzman,” said Pulgar, still smiling.</p>

<p>“Let that be the understanding then,” answered
Guzman as he walked away, without displaying the
slightest concern.</p>

<p>The very next day Guzman sent Pulgar an invitation
to come to the palace at three o’clock and go
driving with him. Contrary to his custom he ordered
that no guards accompany them. They had not gone
a quarter of a mile when one of the front wheels
came off and both of them were thrown out in a
heap. As they disentangled themselves Pulgar drew
a revolver but it was not well out of his pocket before
Guzman had him covered with his pistol.</p>

<p>“Ah, you were prepared for me, I see, General,”
said Pulgar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“I am always prepared for friends and enemies
alike,” replied Guzman.</p>

<p>They put up their weapons and walked back to the
palace.</p>

<p>“I am sorry our ride was so short,” said Guzman.</p>

<p>“It was long enough,” was Pulgar’s reply, “to convert
an enemy into a friend.”</p>

<p>“In that case it has been truly delightful,” responded
Guzman. They shook hands and that was
the end of the Pulgar revolution.</p>

<p>Peace palled on Pulgar and he died not long afterward.
As was his right he had the largest funeral
ever seen in Venezuela. Without exception he was
the bravest man I have ever known. He had all of
Frank Norton’s daring and added to it what seemed
to be a foolhardy recklessness that times without
number carried him right up against old Graybeard’s
scythe, yet he always knew the chances he was taking
and coolly calculated them. When he was stripped
he looked as though he had been run through a
threshing machine. From head to foot he was covered
with scars left by knives, swords, and bullets of
all sizes. In an assault on the fortress at Porto
Cabello, years before I knew him, he climbed into an
embrasure and over the mouth of a cannon just as it
was fired. Had he been a second later he would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
been blown to pieces. The explosion burned nearly
all the flesh off his legs and reduced them to pipe-stems.
He was a tall, handsome man of pure Castilian
blood; a revolutionist by birth, breeding,
education, and occupation, and his one ambition was
to be President of Venezuela. I doubt if that country
will ever produce another just like him.</p>

<p>It was known that Guzman favored the introduction
of foreign capital to develop the wonderful
resources of Venezuela, the full extent of which is
not even yet understood, and Caracas was soon over-run
with concession hunters. Many of them sought
my support and offered me all sorts of inducements,
but I told all of them that I had no influence with
Guzman and would not use it if I had, in such ways
as they desired. I always advised Guzman fully as to
whom the concession hunters were and what they
wanted. One of those on whom I thus reported was
Cyrenius Fitzgerald, an American civil engineer, who
sought a concession covering the delta of the Orinoco
and a considerable distance up the river, which section
then was an unknown land. Guzman wanted a
report on it and asked me to visit it, which I did, in
company with Fitzgerald and an English engineer
named Tucker, who was there making a survey for
the railroad which subsequently was built between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Caracas and La Guaira. We made the trip on the
old government boat “Bolivar,” being away two
months and going up the Orinoco as far as Ciudad
Bolivar. We went over much of the territory included
in the proposed concession and explored many
uncharted passages in the delta of the river which
had long been safe havens for revolutionists and
smugglers. I became enchanted with the country,
which was rich in minerals and valuable woods. In
reporting to Guzman and talking with him about the
project, I found that he was to receive a large block
of stock in the enterprise. This concession finally
was granted by Guzman in 1883, without any solicitation
from me, and thirteen years later it was
decreed by fate that I should become manager of the
property for the Orinoco Company, Limited, which
is now known as the Orinoco Corporation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE MAROONING OF A TRAITOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; HAD been with Guzman Blanco for about a year
after he proclaimed himself Dictator of Venezuela,
on February 14, 1871, when I began to grow restless
again. This was in no sense due to any fault I had
to find with Guzman. He had treated me with every
mark of friendship and had proved, time and again,
that I possessed his entire confidence. He had paid
me fifty thousand dollars for the cargo of arms which
Pulgar secured through Ortega’s forgery and had
been liberal in other financial matters, though I would
not accept any direct payment for my confidential
services, as I considered myself, in a sense, his guest.
But, under the strong hand of Guzman, things were
settling down to a humdrum, and I rebelled against
peace and order and fretted under the restraint of the
land. At sea I could go where I pleased, when I
pleased, and do what I pleased; on shore, except for
the Yellow House and the evening social events, all
of which were alike, my time was largely divided
between Madam Santa Amand’s hotel in Caracas and
the old Posada Neptuno in La Guaira, and my movements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
were circumscribed by the part I was playing.
Then, too, revolutions were popping in Central America,
according to the reports that reached Caracas,
and I felt that I was missing a lot of excitement and
some business. This latter consideration entered into
my thoughts not largely, and at all only because my
expenses were greatly in excess of the amounts I
received from Guzman in roundabout ways. In those
days and for years afterward, I gratified my foolishly
extravagant tastes without any regard to the cost of
things; it is only within recent years that I have come
to understand that money has a value.</p>

<p>With my whole nature clamoring for a change to
more strenuous scenes I put the situation up to
Guzman and secured his permission to go away, on
the promise that I would return within six months.
I summoned the “Juliette” from Curacoa and set
sail for England, for the double purpose of securing
a cargo of arms, with which to add to the joy of living
in Central America, and looking up Frank Norton,
who had so well planted within me the germ of his
China Sea insanity that it was taking root. With
the good little ship heeled over to the steady trade
winds that fanned my dusky cheek, lovingly as I
fancied in my enthusiasm, and with the waters that
are nowhere else so blue murmuring a welcome back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
to them, I was again a rover of the sea and my
exultant soul joined in the lyric chorus of the rigging.</p>

<p>We stopped at St. Thomas, that haven of thieves,
blacklegs, and revolutionists, and there I met General
Baez, brother of Buenaventura Baez, President of
Santo Domingo, and his Minister of War. Buenaventura
Baez was one of the most interesting
characters the romantic West Indies have produced.
He was the son of a rich mulatto and was born early
in the last century. He coöperated with General
Santana in establishing the independence of Santo
Domingo and was President from 1849 to 1853, when
he was supplanted by Santana, who expelled him
from the island. Santana was deposed three years
later and Baez, who had spent the interval in New
York, resumed the presidency. Two years later he
was once more ousted by Santana and forced to live
abroad until 1865, when he again assumed the presidency.
In 1866 General Pimental headed a successful
revolt in favor of General Cabral, and Baez was banished
a third time, going to St. Thomas. His star
was in eclipse only a short while, however, for the
following year he again fought his way to the presidential
chair. In the latter part of 1869 he signed two
treaties with President Grant, one for the cession of
Samana Bay, which probably is the most beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
harbor in the West Indies and was wanted by our
Navy Department for years before these treaties were
signed and for many years afterward, and the other
for the annexation of the whole island of Santo
Domingo to the United States. The people of Santo
Domingo approved both of these conventions at an
election decreed by Baez in February, 1870, and held
under the guns of an American warship, but the
United States Senate refused to ratify either treaty.
President Grant believed strongly in this annexation,
wherein he showed his farsightedness, and a commission
which he sent to the island reported, in the
Spring of 1871, in favor of the treaty; but sentiment
in the Senate was decidedly against it and the measure
was not pressed.</p>

<p>If Grant could have lived until to-day he would find
considerable satisfaction in the protectorate the
United States has assumed over Santo Domingo,
which really amounts to American control. The
same course must be taken with helpless Hayti, and
it may well be that before these lines are read the
administration of the finances of the “Black Republic”
will have been taken over by American officers;
and the American minister, acting under orders from
Washington, will be the real ruler of the land, as he
is in Santo Domingo. Let me digress here to express<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the conviction that within ten years every European
possession in the West Indies, with the possible exception
of Barbadoes, will come under the Stars and
Stripes. Even if economic conditions do not compel
this change, as they would do sooner or later, it will
be made necessary by the completion of the Panama
Canal. The United States, though seldom given to
any riotous display of good sense, is still too wise a
nation to permit a foreign power to have a naval base
almost within gunshot of Colon, from which it could
strike a quick and destructive blow at the inter-oceanic
waterway.</p>

<p>Conditions are ripe for the change. England has
made a failure of governing her islands and, in advance
of formal retirement, has abandoned her great
naval station at Saint Lucia, on which millions of
pounds were spent, and withdrawn her warships from
the Caribbean. The Danish Islands are a heavy and
continuous drain on the Copenhagen treasury that
cannot be maintained for many years longer, and
Washington years ago, through clear-visioned John
Hay, served formal notice on Denmark that the sale
of these islands to any nation except the United
States would be regarded as an unfriendly act. It
was the determination then to keep these islands
away from the outstretched hands of Germany, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of their proximity to South America, and there
are many more reasons now to prevent their transfer
to any foreign power. They are so largely owned by
Americans that they are practically American
colonies to-day. The French Islands are the most
prosperous of all, but only because of a bounty on
sugar which the national government is anxious to
drop. Holland has no reason for retaining her
islands, which are an expense to which no glory
attaches. Under American ownership these beauty
spots would be restored to their old-time prosperity
and no one knows this so well as the islanders themselves.
In my judgment it is a matter of only a comparatively
few years until England, France, Denmark,
and the Netherlands will enter into some arrangement,
the details of which I do not attempt to predict,
by which all of their Caribbean islands will
be turned over to the United States. The only possible
exception is Barbadoes, which England may
wish to retain as a midway station on her commercial
highway to South America, but as that poverty-stricken
islet, which has twice disappeared under the
sea and then bobbed up again, has no port that could
be defended, there might be no objection to such a
plan. Cuba is certain to become an American possession,
for the Cubans are as incapable of self-government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
as are the Filipinos, and if Santo Domingo
and Hayti are not recognized as children of the
United States, they will be its wards. The United
States, too, must take a larger hand in the affairs of
Central America and Venezuela. The Monroe Doctrine
cannot run on one wheel. At the same time that
it protects the Latin-American countries from European
aggression, it must compel them to pay their
debts and maintain order. I am glad, however, that
this theory did not obtain in the old days, for it
would have robbed me of many exciting episodes.</p>

<p>The defeat of Grant’s annexation project gave
Pimental and Cabral an excuse for starting a new
revolution, and they were beginning to show their
hand when I ran into General Baez at St. Thomas.
He knew of my association with Guzman Blanco and
at once approached me with a proposition to go to
Santo Domingo to aid his brother in the troubles
he foresaw. He also suggested that I might undertake
a mission to America or Europe in relation to
the readjustment of the debts of the island, which
even then were becoming burdensome and a source
of much anxiety to the party in power, because of
the insistent belief of the creditors that they were
entitled to their money when it was due. I told him I
knew nothing at all about finances but that, if I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
get an extension of leave from Guzman, I would consider
any practical plan that promised excitement.
He said he would consult with his brother and write
me at Caracas.</p>

<p>We went on to London, where I learned that Norton
was in the Mediterranean with the “Leckwith,”
impatiently carrying general cargoes. I left word for
him with Nickell &amp; Son that I expected soon to be
ready to go out East with him, took on a cargo of arms
and headed for Costa Rica, where I had information
that a revolution was hatching against Gen. Tomaso
Guardia, who had recently come into power. For this
trip, I remember, I took the name of “Captain John
F. Kinnear.” We had some trouble in getting away,
for the British Government was still dead set against
filibustering, and in the hope of removing all suspicion
I gave our destination as Kingston, Jamaica,
though I had no idea of stopping there. I gave the
ship a new set of papers, showing British registry,
and was, of course, flying the British flag.</p>

<p>We ran into bad weather in the Caribbean and were
forced, after all, to put in at Kingston, leaking badly.
The ship was so opened up, in fact, that she had to
be recalked and have a few new planks, which
necessitated putting her in dry dock. The port regulations
stipulated that when a ship went in dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
dock a general cargo could be left in her, at the option
and risk of the owner, but that all explosives and
munitions of war must be taken out and stored in the
government arsenal, or in some place selected by the
commandant. There was nothing for it but to take
out our cargo, and five days were consumed in loading
and repairing the ship. I had the work hurried with
all possible speed, for the mail ship from England was
due in nine days after our arrival and I was fearful
that she would bring an order for our detention, which,
as a matter of fact, she did, as I learned years afterward.
When the repairs were completed the governor
of the island refused to allow us to reload our
cargo, as he had an intimation that the ship was not
what she pretended to be. This hint, it developed
later, came from Jimmy Donovan, a “sea lawyer”
whom I had shipped at the last minute in the hurry
of getting away from London. He made what is
known on the sea as a “pier-head jump.” On the
fourth day I prevailed on the governor to allow us
to take on our cargo, but he insisted that the ship
must be held, with both anchors down, until further
orders. I decided that we would go out that night
and so informed Lorensen, the sailing master.
Knowing me even as well as he did he laughed incredulously,
thinking I was joking, for the channel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
through the harbor was shaped like the letter “S” and
commanded by a fort which could, as he said, blow
us out of the water without half trying.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” I said, “we are going to sea or
to hell to-night.”</p>

<p>“All right, Captain, but it will be to hell, if I am
any judge,” was the quiet reply of the game Lorensen,
than whom a braver or better seaman never
walked a deck. During the evening he greased all of
the blocks so we could start on our problematical
journey without any noise. The moon went down at
midnight and before it was out of sight we had one
anchor up, with a muffled capstan. We were getting
up the other when the harbor policeman came
along. A few Bank of England notes blinded him
and we got under way, with two of the ship’s boats
towing us and the tide helping us along. Evidently
the fort had orders to look out for us but we caught
them napping, apparently, for we were almost past it
when we were hailed and ordered to stop. In a minute,
without giving us a decent chance to heave to,
even had we been so inclined, they whanged away at
us. The second shot went clear through us, just
below the waterway, and Lorensen, who was with
me at the wheel, exclaimed grimly, “Here we go,
Captain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>But he was mistaken, for in the darkness their
gunnery was not up to the standard of British
marksmanship, for which I have a wholesome respect.
They kept at it hard enough but all of their shots
went wild, except for one that punched a hole in the
port bulwarks forward, though from the way the
shells whistled I have no doubt our canvas would
have been punctured many times, had it been up.
We were soon under cover of the Myrtle Bank Hotel
and after that two ships protected us until we were
far enough away so that only a chance shot could
reach us. When we were well enough out in the harbor
so that we could manœuvre and get the full effect
of the light breeze that was blowing over the salt
flats, we set all of our sails and pulled away.</p>

<p>At daylight I had the carpenter at work fixing up
the little damage the fort had done us, and it was
well that we were quick about it for during the afternoon
we met the old warship “Bellerephon,” which
was attached to that station, coming in from a trip
around the island ten days ahead of time. We were
preparing to salute her when she stopped and hove
us to with a blank shot. I don’t think I have ever
been more surprised, for there was no wireless telegraph
in those days and I could not conceive how she
had gotten word that we were suspected of filibustering.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
While I was racking my brain for some solution
of the problem Lorensen ran forward, leaned
out over the side, and came back and reported that
there was a blue shirt under the bobstay. That
explained it, for in those days it was an unwritten law
in the British Navy that when a sailor on a merchant
ship had any pronounced complaint to make, regarding
either his own treatment or general conditions on
the vessel, he would hang a shirt in the chains, under
the bowsprit, where it would not be seen by the
officers unless they were looking for it, as a signal to
any warship they met that there was something
wrong on board. Whenever and wherever a warship
saw a shirt fluttering under the bobstay the vessel
was held up and carefully investigated.</p>

<p>I suspected at once that it was Jimmy Donovan
who had hung out the shirt, and I had him bucked
and gagged and stowed away in the hold before he
could have said “Jack Robinson.” Then, quickly, I
made an entry on the log which showed that he had
been left in the hospital at Kingston, with pernicious
fever. By that time the lieutenant from the “Bellerephon”
was alongside. When he came aboard I
assumed a look of injured innocence and profound
surprise. He ordered me to muster the crew aft and
called for my papers. To my great satisfaction he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
merely glanced at the certificate of registry, which
was forged, and centred his attention on the crew list.
The men answered to their names as he called them
off. When he came to Donovan I explained that
he had been taken sick at Kingston and left there,
and produced the log, which satisfied him.</p>

<p>“Who among you has any complaint to make?”
he asked of the men. There was no response, and he
repeated the question.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” he encouraged them. “The
‘Bellerephon’ will protect you. If you have any complaint
to make, step out and make it. We will see
that you get fair play and, if necessary, take you on
board.”</p>

<p>No one moved, and after waiting some time the
lieutenant turned to me with the remark that everything
seemed to be all right. I told him I had heard
of no complaints from any of the men and asked why
they had “stood us up.”</p>

<p>“Why, there is a shirt out forward,” he explained.
I suggested that perhaps some of the crew had been
washing. Hearing my remark a quick-witted fellow
named Bill Johnson, who had shipped on my first
trip with the “Juliette,” stepped out and said he had
washed his shirt that morning and hung it in the
chains to dry, without knowing that it meant anything.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
“I’ve been a sailor for a good many years but
that is one signal I never heard of before,” he said.</p>

<p>“Is that true, Bill?” asked the lieutenant with
what seemed like just a shade of suspicion.</p>

<p>“It is, sir,” replied Bill with the steady gaze of an
honest man.</p>

<p>“He is a ‘True Bill’ all right,” I told the young
officer as I shot a grateful look at the grizzled sailor
that meant a raise in wages. “He is the oldest man
on the ship and one of the best. That shirt signal is
a new one on me, too, and I thought I knew all the
signs of the sea.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” he replied. “It is quite evidently
a mistake.”</p>

<p>He then returned to the “Bellerephon,” which
answered our salute, and we squared away for Costa
Rica. My mind was free from any further fear of
capture, for a stiff breeze was singing over our quarter,
and I knew by the time the old warship could get
to Kingston and start after us again we would be well
out of reach. As soon as she was hull down I mustered
the crew aft and complimented Bill on his
ready wit and rewarded it. He was with me for
years after that and was never known by any other
name than “True Bill.”</p>

<p>I then reminded the men that, in accordance with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
my invariable rule when running contraband, I had
told all of them the exact nature of our voyage before
we were out of sight of land and had offered to set
ashore any who did not wish to undertake it, while
those who stayed with me were to receive double
pay, and a bonus out of the profits in addition, in
consideration of the hazardous nature of the trip.</p>

<p>“Therefore,” I told them, “the treachery of Donovan
has not only endangered your extra pay and
bonus but also placed your freedom in jeopardy. As
he was one of your number I will turn him over to
you for such punishment as you think his case
deserves. I, of course, reserve the right to review your
verdict, but I do not believe you will be too lenient
with him.” The crew welcomed this announcement
with cheers, which could not be regarded as a good
omen for the traitor, and a court-martial was
organized, with the “bos’n” at the head of it.</p>

<p>Donovan confessed when he was brought before
the court, whereupon it was unanimously and
speedily decided that he should run the gantlet and
be marooned, which verdict I approved, for I believed
it to be none too severe. The crew prepared for the
first ceremony by knotting a lot of rope ends and
tarring them until they were as hard as iron but
flexible. They then formed in a double line the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
full length of the ship and as Donovan ran down the
middle of it they laid on so well that he was leaving
a trail of blood before he tumbled in a heap at the
end. He was then placed in the brig and kept there
until we came to a small island off the Costa Rican
coast, on which he was landed with enough water
and provisions to last him a couple of weeks or more
and a flag that he could use to signal any vessel coming
his way. There was not a great deal of travel
down that way in those days and he may still be
there, doing a repetition of the Robinson Crusoe act,
though the island was not very large and the boat’s
crew that landed him reported that they saw no goats.
Donovan was helpless from fear when he was lowered
into the boat to be rowed to the island, and begged
for mercy, but that was something our cargo did not
contain.</p>

<p>The arms we carried were sold to the revolutionists
in Costa Rica, being paid for partly in cash and partly
in coffee, which I sold at Curacoa. From there I
returned to Venezuela and reported to Guzman
Blanco, after having been away only about four
months. Not long after my arrival in Caracas, where
I resumed my old position as confidential agent for
Guzman, I received a letter from President Baez asking
me to enter his employ, to reorganize his army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and aid him in suppressing the revolutionary feeling
which was being developed by agents for Pimental
and Cabral. He offered to give me a commission as
General in the Santo Domingan Army, which he did
do later, and to pay me liberally for my services,
which he didn’t do. I replied that I had again associated
myself with Guzman and that while no length
of service had been specified, I wished to remain with
him at least a short while, after which I would try to
get leave to join the Santo Domingans.</p>

<p>Guzman was paving the way for his election as
Constitutional President, which was accomplished the
next year, 1873, and all of his friends were working
to that end. He was supported by a public sentiment
that became practically unanimous, but there were a
few who were unalterably opposed to any established
order of things and who could not get over the habit
of “revoluting,” with or without provocation. During
the Fall and Winter these discontented ones gradually
drew together under the leadership of General
Pulido. Guzman was kept advised as to what they
were doing but their following was so small that it
caused him no uneasiness and, to further strengthen
himself with the people, he determined to take no
steps against them until they came out in the open,
when he was prepared to crush them. The moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
the rebels raised their banners Guzman took the field
against them, in person. At the head of an army of
four thousand veterans he marched to Valencia where
he met Pulido and routed him, following up his scattered
forces and almost annihilating them, and the
revolt was stamped out with one smashing blow.
That was the last hand raised against Guzman for
seventeen years; during all of that time he was the
absolute dictator of Venezuela. The constitution prohibited
the President from succeeding himself so he
occupied that office for alternate terms, with an
obedient dummy serving in the intervals, which he
spent in Europe as Minister Plenipotentiary, directing
the government by mail. His rule was wise and
progressive. Railroads were built, roads improved,
schools established, and real religious liberty took the
place of clericalism. He was betrayed, in the end, by
his supposed friends, men whom he had raised to
prominence and prosperity. Had he been succeeded
by a man as strong and able as himself Venezuela
would to-day be the foremost country in South
America, instead of the one most uncivilized.</p>

<p>Not long after the campaign against Pulido, in
which I served on Guzman’s staff, I received another
letter from Baez, urging me to come to Santo
Domingo. The same mail brought a letter from Baez<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
to Guzman, asking him to grant me leave of absence
for a few months to enter his service. Guzman was
flattered by this request and with his permission I
went to Santo Domingo City in the Spring of 1873,
on the “Juliette.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>A SWIFT VENGEANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PRESIDENT BAEZ of Santo Domingo was short
and thin and had a washed-out look, as though his
skin had been faded by chemicals instead of by a three-quarters’
admixture of white blood. He had large full
eyes that were shifty and insincere. He was clever
but superficial, cunning and treacherous. Had I seen
him before I went to his cursed country, to reorganize
his army and aid in putting down the growing
revolutionary sentiment, I would have remained
in Venezuela or gone elsewhere in search of adventure,
for he looked a coward and provoked distrust.
I had heard of him only as a good fighter but that
reputation, I became convinced soon after my first
visit to the “palace,” had been earned for him by his
former friends and supporters and was in no sense
the work of his own sword, at least so far as recent
years were concerned. In his earlier days he might
have displayed more bravery, and he must have
shown some courage to arouse a fighting degree of
loyalty that had four times swept the country, but
presuming that to be true he had gone back greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
with advancing age. He seemed to have convinced
the superstitious mulattoes, with whom the still
more fanatical full-blooded blacks were always at
war, that he was a real man of destiny whose course
could not safely be interfered with, and his successive
successes probably were due more to that belief than
to any other cause. His brother, the Minister of
War, had all of the President’s faults in accentuated
form and added to them an inordinate vanity. He
was jealous of me from the start. He had expected
that I would recommend to him such changes in the
“military establishment” as I thought wise, but I
insisted on doing things myself and having a free
hand, which the President was quite willing to give
me, perhaps because he was suspicious of even his
own brother.</p>

<p>The “army” was, in reality, not much more than
an unorganized body of densely ignorant natives
who, as practically the only compensation for their
supposed loyalty, were allowed to carry guns, which
they did not know how to use. I taught them how
to march without getting in each other’s way, how to
handle their arms without shooting themselves, and
as much discipline as they were amenable to, but I
fear my efforts did not go much beyond that even
though they did effect a decided improvement. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
of my first recommendations to the President was
that he buy and fit out two small gunboats with which
to patrol the coast and hold in check such revolutionary
centres as Monte Cristi, under threat of bombardment.
They could also be used, as I pointed out,
to transport troops quickly to rebelliously inclined
districts. The President thought well of the plan and,
though I advised steamers, he directed that the
“Juliette,” for which he agreed to pay a fair price,
be converted into such a craft. I ordered five small
rapid-fire guns sent from England to Halifax, Nova
Scotia, and, the revolutionary spirit seemingly having
subsided with the improvement in the army, took the
“Juliette” there in the Summer of 1873, to have her
decks strengthened and mount the cannon. We
returned early in the Fall to find that the smouldering
revolution had burst into a flame and a large force
was marching on Santo Domingo City, and only a
few miles away. When I reached the palace the President
and his brother were vehemently but vainly advising
each other to be brave.</p>

<p>“What shall we do—what shall we do?” demanded
the President as I entered the door.</p>

<p>“It strikes me that it might be a good scheme to
fight,” I replied, with no attempt to conceal my disgust
at their attitude. “In fact, I should say it is up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
to us to fight, and fight until we are all bloody, if we
have to.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, but where?” queried the trembling chief
executive.</p>

<p>“Go out and meet them,” I advised. “They probably
will not be looking for us, as I judge that would
be a departure from the established Santo Domingan
method of warfare, and we may be able to take
them at a disadvantage.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” urged the panic-stricken Minister of
War, “let us wait until they get into the city and
then bombard them with your guns.”</p>

<p>“Which would mean,” I said, “killing four or five
of your own people to every one of the enemy. I
am not used to that way of fighting and don’t know
how to do it.”</p>

<p>They told me there were about three thousand men
in the attacking force. We had more than four thousand
men under arms, which gave us the advantage
of numbers. The city had no defences worthy the
name and I insisted that the thing to do was to go
outside and fight it out in the open, while the doughty
General, who seemed to be seeking delay more than
anything else, was in favor of making a rough-and-tumble
of it in the town. The President, who had
imbibed something of American ideas during his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
three years’ residence in New York, and who had
apparently regained a little of his nerve while we
were canvassing the situation, agreed with me, and,
against the continued objections of his brother, we
went out to meet the attacking army.</p>

<p>Gen. Baez commanded our centre and right while
I commanded our left flank. His reason for wanting
to postpone the action was quickly apparent, for he
was an arrant coward. He began to give way, before
a force that was inferior in both numbers and discipline,
with the firing of the first gun, and fell back
so rapidly that before I realized it my command was
flanked and almost cut off, with the sea on one side
of us and the enemy on two others and rapidly closing
up the fourth. My men fought surprisingly well
until they suddenly discovered that they were almost
surrounded, when they promptly went into a panic.
Most of them dropped their guns and ran for the city,
with an activity of which I had not dreamed them
capable, while nearly all of the others, in regular
South American fashion, about-faced and joined the
rebels on the spot. In a few minutes I was captured,
along with about a hundred men who were so
numbed by fear that they could neither run nor fight,
and had not enough discretion to join the enemy. I
was furious over the cowardice of Baez and put up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the hardest fight I was capable of, with the satisfaction
of putting six or eight blacks on a permanent
peace basis, but with my revolver empty and my
sword broken I was overwhelmed by the inky cloud.
Gen. Baez galloped back to the city and he and his
bewildered brother, the President, had barely time to
board a small schooner and sail for Curacoa before the
capital was in the hands of the rebels. Gen. Ganier
d’Aton, a tool of Pimental and Cabral, was at once
proclaimed President, and hailed by the populace
with the customary acclaim.</p>

<p>Instead of being killed at once, as I had expected
to be, I was taken to a small fort on a hill near the
town where, on the trumped-up and altogether false
charge that I had fomented trouble and brought on
civil war, I was tried by drum-head court-martial and
sentenced to be shot at sunrise. The verdict was, of
course, dictated by revenge, and execution of it was
delayed because they wished to gloat over me for a
while. This was a little the most serious predicament
I had ever been in and, with the idea of taking every
chance that was open to me rather than with any distinct
hope that it would be answered, I gave the grand
hailing sign of a powerful secret order which I had
joined while in Caracas. I thought I saw a sergeant
raise his eyes but, as he gave no further sign, I concluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
that if there had been any movement it had
been one of surprise and not of recognition. I was
placed in a large sala with windows opening on the
courtyard and blank walls on the other three sides.
The windows were barred and after satisfying myself
that they were secure, and that there was no way of
escape, I laid down and smoked, reflecting that if my
time had come there was no way of interfering with
the programme scheduled for the break of day. The
soldiers were drinking and celebrating their victory
with shouts and songs, which lessened in volume and
vehemence as the night wore on, but two sentries who
paced back and forth in front of my room and met under
one of the windows religiously kept sober. Now
and then a drunken coterie would press their dirty
faces against the bars to hurl at me denunciatory
bursts of Spanish eloquence, to which I vigorously replied,
but these enlivening visits grew less and less
frequent, as the consumption of <i>tafia</i> rum increased.</p>

<p>Along about three o’clock, just as I had about made
up my mind that in a couple of hours I would be
due to start on an indefinite exploration into regions
about which nothing is known except that no
traveller ever returns from them, I heard a short
scuffle at each end of the path the sentries were
patrolling and a gurgling noise as though a man was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
choking. The next moment Lorensen’s voice came
softly through the door, “Are you in there, Captain?”
I assured him that I was.</p>

<p>“Stand away from the door,” he said, and I obeyed
the order with pleasurable alacrity. Three blows
with a log of crutch mahogany taken from a pile in
the courtyard which had been brought in from the
mountains for export, smashed in the door. Lorensen
seized my arm and, led by the sergeant who had,
after all, recognized the sign I had made and answered
it, we climbed down a declivity back of the fort
and made our way to the shore, where two boats
were waiting for us. The smashing in of the door of
my prison aroused the drowsy guard and we were
hardly well out of the fort before there was a beating
of drums and loud shouts from the few half sober
officers, directed at the soundly sleeping soldiers.
They finally mustered a detachment which was sent
in pursuit of us, but they were not in a condition to
move rapidly and did not reach the shore until we
were a considerable distance away from it. They
fired a few shots in the general direction of the sea
but as we were in no danger of being hit we did not
raise a gun.</p>

<p>When we got out to the “Juliette” I heard the story
of my deliverance. I had been taken prisoner about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
the middle of the afternoon and it was early in the
evening when the death sentence was passed on me.
The sergeant, whose name was Alexandro, had understood
my signal. He went into the city as soon as he
could get away from the fort and, by persistent questioning
of the natives, finally ascertained that I was in
command of the American ship lying in the harbor,—for
I had not hoisted the Santo Domingan flag on the
“Juliette.” He then rowed out to the ship and, after
telling Lorensen what had happened, through a member
of the crew who could speak Spanish, offered
to lead a rescuing party to the place where I was confined.
He said it would be comparatively easy to get
me away as only a small body of troops had been left
at the fort, the supply of rum in the city being much
larger, and they would be helpless from drink.</p>

<p>Lorensen, being a member of the same order, could
well understand why a white man should have taken
the deep personal interest in my welfare which Alexandro
manifested, but he was suspicious that the negro
was seeking to lead him into a trap. He decided,
however, to take no chances, so, after warning Alexandro
that he would be the first man killed if he
attempted any treachery, Lorensen went ashore with
sixteen well-armed men, six of whom were left with
the boats while the others proceeded to the old fort.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
They surprised the two sentries at the opposite ends
of their beat, throttled them and, as the surest means
of preventing an outcry, cut their throats, which accounted
for the gurgling noise I had heard. Then
they broke in the door of the <i>sala</i>, in which operation
they were obliged to make enough noise to arouse the
guard.</p>

<p>Such are the obligations of a great secret order.</p>

<p>Men whom I sent ashore reported that President
Baez and his brother had fled and the rebels were in
full control of the government, and as soon as it was
day I sailed close in and bombarded the fort where
my execution was to have taken place. There was a
great helter-skeltering of rum-soaked braves when
the first shells exploded around their ears, but there
were some who did not get away, and the crumbling
walls came down and buried them. Then we headed
for Venezuela again, after an experience that paid me
only in excitement. I had not drawn a dollar from
Baez and I had been obliged to pay for the changes
made in the “Juliette” and for the guns that were
brought from England, for I could not find a banker
in Halifax who would advance a cent on the letter of
credit from the great Republic of Santo Domingo.
Still, I figured that the experience had furnished me
enough excitement to justify its cost. Several years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
later I met Gen. Baez again in Murphy’s Hotel at St.
Thomas but did not see him until he took a good-natured
shot at me. The bullet smashed a pile of
dishes on the arm of a waiter ten feet away from me,
and from the start that waiter made I would not be
surprised to hear that he is running yet around the
hills back of Charlotte Amalia.</p>

<p>At Caracas I found that Guzman had been duly
elected Constitutional President. He was inaugurating
a scheme of public improvements, the country
had settled down to business, and the prospect was
all for long continued peace, which was displeasing
to me and I wanted to get away again. However,
Guzman had a plan to keep me busy. There was not
then, nor is there now for that matter, a decent map
of Venezuela. It was reported from Paris that a
Frenchman had gone up the Orinoco to its headwaters
and had found that the Casiquiare River,
which empties into it, formed a natural canal connecting
with the Rio Negro, which runs into the
Amazon at Manaos, Brazil. Guzman proposed that
I go over this route and seek to verify the Frenchman’s
report. Exploring unknown lands has always
been as much a passion with me as aiding and abetting
revolutions, and I willingly accepted the commission,
but, though I did not tell Guzman so, I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
no intention of returning to Caracas. As an evidence
of my appreciation of his friendship I gave him a
Jurgensen watch, which I had had made to order,
and the “Juliette,” just as she stood, sending Lorensen
and one or two others to London to work under
the direction of my agents until I should arrive. He
used the good little ship for years as a mail boat between
La Guaira and Curacoa. Guzman gave me a
Damascus sword of exquisite workmanship, which, not
long afterward, I used with good effect on the pirates
of the China Sea.</p>

<p>He wanted the exploration made on a grand scale
and suggested that he send along a detachment of
soldiers. I convinced him that his plan was impracticable,
for a small party could get through much
more easily than a large one. Late in October I went
to Trinidad to outfit for the trip. There, at the old
Ice House Hotel, I met two young Britishers who
were men after my own heart: Dr. Rogers, a rich
Church of England clergyman who preferred the
legitimate pleasures of this world to the prospects of
the next, and Frank Anderson, son of a wealthy
Glasgow merchant and a recent graduate of Edinburgh
University. They had come out to hunt for
big game and were outfitting for a trip up the Orinoco.
When I told them where I was going they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
expressed a great desire to accompany me and I
readily agreed. I was glad to have such good companions
for the long and probably dangerous journey,
for it was a tradition that there were many “bad
Indians” far up the river. I was the commandant
of the party, Rogers was the scientist, and Anderson
the provider. They had brought out from England
two Peacock collapsible boats and to complete our
fleet I bought an Orinoco <i>lancha</i>, a large flat-bottomed
scow with a single enormous sail.</p>

<p>We went up as far as Ciudad Bolivar, the head of
steam navigation, on the old side-wheeler “Bolivar,”
and there took to our boats, which were provisioned
for six months and carried seven natives to do the
hard work. There was only a slight current in the
river, which was at low stage as it was then “midsummer”—their
winter comes with the rainy season
in our midsummer,—while the steady trade wind
from the Atlantic blew straight upstream, so we made
good progress under sail. It was a lazy trip in the
early stages and a tiresome one, for there were only
a few dirty hamlets along the way and the llanos
stretched away on both sides of us in an interminable
monotony. At the confluence of the Apure and
Arauca Rivers, two hundred and fifty miles above
Ciudad Bolivar, we found a great inland delta, larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
and more bewildering than that at the mouth of the
Orinoco where there are thirty-six separate channels
that have been charted. This delta, like the one on
the coast, was formed by the tremendous force and
volume of the “midwinter” floods, which had built up
so many islands of soft mud that it was at times difficult
for us to stick to the main stream.</p>

<p>One of our most interesting experiences was at the
junction of the Rio Meta and the Orinoco, one hundred
and fifty miles farther on, where we encountered
the so-called “musical stones,” of which we had heard
marvellous tales from the natives. These are granite
cliffs which, we had been told, gave out at sunrise
sounds closely resembling the tones of an organ. This
mythical music, as we regarded it, caused us to stay
here several days and finally, on one very cool morning,
by placing our ears to the rocks, we distinctly
heard subterranean growls, groans, and whistles,
which could without great stretch of the imagination
be compared to the notes of an organ, though it must
needs be a wheezy one to make the similarity approximately
honest. We all knew something about geology
and, without pretending to give a scientific
conclusion, it was our opinion that the sounds were
caused by the hot air of the day, which the rocks retained
during the night, being driven out by the cool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
air of the early morning through narrow fissures that
were partially obstructed by thin layers of mica, lying
at an angle to the general stratification, which served
as reeds. The resultant vibrations were musical
enough to produce a weird sensation as we listened
to them, and it was easy to imagine the effect they
would have on the ignorant and superstitious natives,
and the stories for which they furnished a foundation.
The Orinoco is navigable as far as the Meta for light-draft
steamers at all seasons of the year, but it may
be centuries before the “musical stones” become an
advertised attraction for tourists.</p>

<p>At Atures, one hundred miles above, and again at
Maypures, just beyond, were two rapids around which
our boats had to be carried; but with these exceptions
it was plain sailing, or paddling, until we crossed
the line into Brazil. Another hundred miles beyond
the rapids brought us to the jumping-off place of the
world—the indescribably filthy little hamlet of San
Fernando de Atabapo, built where the Guaviare
River comes down from the mountains of Colombia
to join the Orinoco. It is on the border of Venezuela
and Colombia and its population is largely made up
of murderers and escaped convicts from both countries,
with a few from near-by Brazil. A number of
the leading citizens undertook to waylay us as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
were leaving the place but the only result of their
misguided effort was that two or three of them received
what the law would have administered if it had
been given a chance.</p>

<p>From the time we left Ciudad Bolivar we had been
sailing through a veritable wilderness, with human
habitations few and far between, but after we left San
Fernando de Atabapo we travelled through the primeval
forest, which came down to the river’s edge
on both sides. Its only inhabitants were widely scattered
Indians, who were inquisitive enough but not
at all ugly. There were miles and miles of magnificent
rubber trees, which were especially abundant
along the Casiquiare, and great stretches of vanilla
and cacao growing wild. The Orinoco is indeed a
wasted waterway. The vast empire it drains, covering
more than half of Venezuela, is marvellously rich
in minerals and in its forests, and could easily be made
as rich in agriculture. Yet when we made our trip
there were fewer people living along it than there had
been four hundred years before when Ordaz, the
Spanish explorer, ascended it to the mouth of the Meta,
and I doubt if there has been any increase in the population
since our visit. Ten Hudson Rivers could be
added to or taken from the Orinoco without affecting
it, yet it is traversed only by the native <i>lanchas</i> and
<i>bongos</i>, or dugouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>We turned into the Casiquiare River, two hundred
miles above San Fernando de Atabapo, with considerable
regret, for we would have greatly liked to follow
the Orinoco to its unexplored source in the mysterious
Parima Mountains, where is said to dwell a
race of white Indians, who are popularly supposed to
stand guard, with deadly blow pipes shooting darts
that produce instant death, over vast treasures of
virgin gold. But that would have taken many months
more and we were not prepared for so long a trip.
The priceless forest which surrounded us was filled
with game of all kinds and great snakes, and alive
with birds of wondrous plumage. There were so
many snakes, in fact, that we anchored our boats at
night and slept in them in the middle of the river,
where we had nothing to fear but the enormous
crocodiles which poked us with their ugly snouts to
prevent us from oversleeping. We landed every day
to stretch our legs and shoot, with ridiculous ease,
enough game to keep us in fresh meat, but we never
camped on shore at night.</p>

<p>After following the Casiquiare for one hundred and
fifty miles or more we came to the parting of the
ways—the point at which the Rio Negro, coming
down from the foothills of the Andes, five hundred
miles away, divides to feed both the Orinoco and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Amazon—and solved the mystery of the two rivers.
There was no connecting canal of slack water, as the
Frenchman was said to have reported. The Rio
Negro, a wide and deep stream, forms the boundary
between Venezuela and Colombia for nearly two hundred
miles. At two degrees north latitude, or about
one hundred and twenty miles from the equator, it
divides, the smaller part, approximately one-third of
the volume, forming the Casiquiare, which runs east
for a short distance and then north to the Orinoco,
while the main stream runs south and then east until
it empties into the Amazon at Manaos. Though we
had no map to guide us the situation seemed plain
when we reached the larger river, which fed the
Casiquiare, and by following the downward course
of that stream until we were certain it was the Rio
Negro, we settled the question.</p>

<p>Just below the junction of the Ucayari River with
the Rio Negro, almost directly under the equator, we
came to a succession of falls and rapids around which
we made a portage. From there on, through the same
silent wilderness of natural wealth that we had traversed
for weeks, we leisurely sailed and drifted down
to the Amazon, for the blistering heat discouraged all
physical effort that was not mandatory. It was not
until we reached the lower reaches of the river that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
we found men gathering rubber, and they were taking
only ounces where tons were at their hands. We
reached Manaos early in May, 1874. We had been
six months on the trip and had covered all of two
thousand miles which, everything considered, was
fast travelling. Aside from its educational value the
exploration had been delightful, and though tired from
living so long in cramped quarters we were all in
better health than when we left Trinidad.</p>

<p>My companions, who rejoiced in having been thrown
in the way of greater sport and more interesting
experiences than they had expected to find, were
ready to return to England and I arranged to go
with them. After resting for a week or two we went
down to Para on a river boat and thence to Rio
Janiero on one of the Lloyd Brazilero steamships.
From there we sailed for England on the Royal Mail
steamship “Elbe,” commanded by Captain Moir, who
was in command of the “Trent” when Mason and
Slidell were taken off. On the way across I compiled
a full report of the exploring trip which I mailed to
Guzman, with a promise that I would return to
Venezuela within a few years. I left my British
friends at Southampton and went to London to join
Frank Norton and start for the China Sea, of which
he had pictured so much that was good in my sight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>PREYING ON PIRATES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS a boy it was my ambition to fight Indians, but
if I had known as much about them then as I do
now, I would have selected pirates. They have none of
the claims on life which the real, red, native Americans
enjoy, and they can be fought on the glorious
sea instead of on land, which adds to the inherent
excitement. It was in the Summer of 1874 that I
made my first plunge into piracy, for, with all of the
trimmings and aids to deception stripped away, that
was what it really amounted to. I did not know into
just what I was being led when I embarked in this
new enterprise; but I am frank to say that it would
have made no difference, for a free translation of the
word “pirate” is “adventure of the first order,” and
that was what I was looking for.</p>

<p>When I reached London, after my strange escape
from execution in Santo Domingo and the exploration
of the headwaters of the Orinoco and the Rio Negro,
Frank Norton was coming up from the Mediterranean
with the “Leckwith,” carrying a general cargo, and
I had not long to wait for him. He was joyous when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
told him I was ready to accompany him to the China
Sea, which he had pictured as an El Dorado of excitement,
with many golden Manoas that might be converted
into Bank of England notes. There was to be
no filibustering there for we had no thought of playing
against the concert of Europe with our one little
fiddle, even had there been any prospective revolutions
worth the hatching; but Norton insisted that
there was plenty of adventure to be found and much
money to be made in handling equally illegitimate
cargoes which included no explosives or munitions
of war. As he was familiar with that part of the
world I took his word for it, without going into
minute details. He said we would need the “Leckwith”
and two ships to carry on the business to the
best advantage, so I selected the “Surprise,” an
American brig, and the “Florence,” a topsail schooner,
both stout, fast ships. I put Lorensen on the “Leckwith”
as sailing master, George Brown on the “Surprise,”
and old Bill Heather on the “Florence.” The
“Surprise” took on a general cargo for Japan and
was ordered to rendezvous at Hong Kong, while the
“Florence” loaded for Singapore. Norton and I followed
in the “Leckwith.” Two brass cannon were
mounted in place of the yacht’s guns she carried and
we took on board four small carronades, a French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
<i>mitrailleuse</i>, and several hundred rifles, cutlasses, and
side arms, with an abundance of ammunition, all of
which were stored in the hold.</p>

<p>Before our departure I had printed on parchment,
in exact imitation of the genuine, certificates of
registry in English, Dutch, German, French, and
Spanish, and seals made to correspond to them.
These I filled out, as occasion demanded, in the name
the particular ship bore at the time, and in the
nationality which I thought would furnish the best
protection. I also had certificates of health, consular
clearances and bills of health, custom house clearances,
and shipping certificates printed in different languages.
Forged service certificates were also issued
to old men of long service who were competent
officers but who could not pass the technical examinations
provided for in the amended maritime laws.
These and the certificates of registry were aged with a
solution of iron and, if necessary, rubbed on the cabin
floor to add to their years. I had used similar forged
papers while filibustering in the West Indies but had
never had such an elaborate outfit, though I was never
afterward without it. With these papers I could give
a ship a registry under any flag and make it appear
that she had come from any port that suited my purpose.
They were signed with an illegible scrawl, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
are the genuine. To further complicate matters the
“Leckwith” was supplied with a telescopic smokestack
which, when lowered, was completely hidden.
She was schooner-rigged and could be transformed
into a fore and aft schooner by dousing the stack and
housing the yards on the foremast, or into a brig by
putting yards on the mainmast. Similar changes of
rig could be made on the “Florence” and “Surprise.”
I never used a ship on which this could not be done.
The efficacy of these precautions is proved by the
fact that I have never lost a cargo of contraband,
though I have handled scores of them.</p>

<p>With provision made for all of the deception and
trickery which experience and foresight could suggest
we headed for Singapore, to begin a career of adventure
such as my wild mind never had conceived, even
in its dearest dreams. On the long trip out I whiled
away the time in an effort to evolve a torpedo of a
new type. I had been interested in high explosives
all my life and had long believed that a non-dirigible
torpedo could be devised which would be an improvement
on our own Harvey,—which was towed in a
bridle and was not practicable for a greater distance
than two or three hundred yards,—and which would
have advantages over the dirigible type. To facilitate
my experiments I had on board a lot of sheet brass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
and before the end of the trip I had developed a
torpedo that I regarded as perfection and which I
afterward used with success, though it finally got me
into trouble in South America. It was six feet long,
thirty inches in diameter, and shaped like a fat cigar.
The inside was lined with air cylinders to give it the
required buoyancy, and inside of these was packed
the explosive charge, of wet gun-cotton or dynamite.
It was towed by a wire or small rope attached to the
blunt nose, from which projected six spider-like arms
two feet long, and alternating with these were six
shorter arms extending outward from the thickest
part of the torpedo. The forcing backward of any one
of these arms cut off a shear pin and released a spring
which set off a fulminate of mercury cap. This exploded
a disc of dry gun-cotton which set off the main
charge. The shear pins were of copper wire of any
desired thickness, but were intended to be only thick
enough to prevent the arms from being forced backward,
and the torpedo discharged, by the current of
a river or by the resistance of the water when being
towed or by small driftwood which might be encountered.</p>

<p>The buoyancy of the loaded torpedo could easily
be calculated and by means of the air cylinders it
could be kept awash or floated just below the surface,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
the latter being the preferred method when it was to
be used during the day. The towing wire or rope
was kept on the surface or just below it by small
floats, distributed at such distances that they would
attract no attention even in the improbable event of
their being seen. The torpedo was intended to be
towed across the course of the vessel that was to be
destroyed. The moment the ship’s bow picked up the
towing rope her fate was settled, for whether the
rope was fifty yards or five miles long it was simply
a question of time until the torpedo was dragged
alongside and exploded by the pressure of one of the
arms against the side of the vessel. The torpedo
could be towed astern of a ship or a launch or even
an innocent rowboat. In river work it could be
stretched across the stream with a line at each end,
the shorter one being only strong enough to withstand
the current, so it would part easily when the
unfriendly ship picked up the line attached to the
nose of the torpedo. I was greatly pleased with my
invention and it was not long until I had an opportunity
to prove that it was a complete success.</p>

<p>We reached Singapore more than a month ahead
of the “Florence” and on our arrival there Norton unfolded
his whole scheme to me. The gist of it was
that we were to prey on the pirates who infested the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
China Sea, and particularly that part of it lying between
Singapore, Sumatra, and Borneo, which was
dotted with islands and beautifully suited by nature
to their plundering profession. Every ship going to
Europe from China, Indo-China, Siam, and from the
Philippines and the network of islands to the south
of them, as well as vessels coming up from the Indian
Ocean through the Strait of Sunda, between Sumatra
and Java, had to run the gantlet of this piratical
nest, and many were the good ships that ended their
cruises there, along with their passengers and crews.
It was here the pirates held out last in their long and
bloody fight against civilization, as the present state
of mankind in general is called. The British Government
had been trying for years to put an end to their
operations but there were so many of the islands, and
the opportunities for concealment and escape were
so numerous, that the undertaking was a gigantic
one. It was not until years after my tragic appearance
on this stage that it was officially announced
that piracy had been suppressed. Even that long
delayed declaration was not altogether true, for in that
accursed region, now well known but yet mysterious,
piracy is still being carried on, even to this day,
though in a small and desultory way. There were a
few islands farther north, off the southern coast of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Indo-China, among which the pirates sometimes
rendezvoused to lay in wait for their prey, but in ordinary
weather it was easy for ships to keep clear of
these danger spots. But they could not avoid those
islands lying northeast of Singapore, and it was there
that most of the merchantmen were looted.</p>

<p>The pirates were chiefly Chinese, with a considerable
number of Malays and some Dyaks. As to
bravery and bloodthirstiness there was little choice
between them. They were all desperate villains and
their thirst for gold was exceeded only by their truly
Oriental cunning. When they fell from wounds they
would watch for an opportunity to hamstring their
opponents or disembowel them with their long,
crooked knives, which were as sharp as razors. After
we discovered this devilish trait no quarter was ever
shown them. When one of them fell he was shot
through the head or stabbed, to make sure that he
would do no further harm. Nothing else could be
done with such an enemy. The Chinese operated
chiefly in large junks, with which they could go well
out to sea. Most of them carried guns of considerable
size, while all of them were supplied with a multitude
of stink-pots,—their favorite weapon. These
were round earthenware pots, twelve or fifteen inches
in diameter, filled with a black mixture of the consistency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
of moist earth, which was lighted just before the
missile was thrown. They were handled in a sling,
such as every small boy has used but on a larger scale,
and could be thrown with great accuracy for one hundred
feet or more. When the pot struck the opposing
ship it broke open and the contents spread out on the
deck, giving off a thick, pungent, and vile-smelling
smoke which would quickly produce complete asphyxiation
if it was inhaled at close range. If the smoking
mass was left long enough undisturbed it would set
fire to the ship. The pirates themselves were largely
immune to this horrible smoke and under its cover,
following a rain of stink-pots, they would board a ship
almost unseen and have her defenders, whom they always
outnumbered, at a great disadvantage from the
start. When fighting at close quarters the Chinese
used long, curved swords, something like a Turkish
yataghan, while the Malays were armed with the krese,
a short, double-edged sword with serrated edges. Both
were murderous weapons and the pirates were graduated
experts in the use of them; in fact, they preferred
their butcher knives to firearms, for they were
miserable marksmen. As soon as an engagement
became general they would throw away their guns
and pistols and use their swords, with both hands,
striking powerful, chopping blows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>The Malays and Dyaks used <i>proas</i> or <i>feluccas</i>, light,
strong, low-lying vessels from sixty to one hundred
feet in length, from ten to sixteen feet wide, and five
or six feet deep, with less than three feet draft. They
were rigged with two large lateen sails and were very
fast. The only material difference between them was
that the proas were supplied with long sweeps with
which they could be driven along at a fair rate of
speed when there was no wind. The junks were used
for outside work, while the proas and feluccas kept
close inshore, seldom going more than fifteen miles out.
On account of their shallow draft they were easily hidden
in the mouths of rivers and creeks, and when so
concealed they could not be seen at a distance of half
a mile.</p>

<p>It was this ease of escape, and the fact that unless
they were caught red-handed conviction was impossible,
which combined to make the stamping out of
the pirates such a tremendous task. The junks
always carried just enough cargo to enable them to
pose, technically, as peaceful traders and, with the aid
of their friends afloat and ashore, they could easily
prove an alibi, or anything else that was needed.
When closely pursued by a suspicious warship and
certain to be overhauled and inspected, they would
throw overboard their surplus of arms and, if necessary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
any loot they happened to have on board, to
remove all incriminating evidence. Through an elaborate
system of spies the pirate chiefs were constantly
advised as to the movements of the warships and kept
their craft as far away from them as possible. Thus
it was that unless a cruiser happened along just as a
merchantman was being looted, and her crew butchered,
or immediately afterward, the chance of capturing
the scoundrels was remote. Even with the
large retributive fleet of cruisers and gunboats that
finally was established in those waters, beauteous
and romantic but thickly dotted with villainous
havens, the number of piracies that were punished,
including the joyous justice which Norton and I
meted out, was trifling when compared with the total
of murder and robbery.</p>

<p>The chief of a large section of the Chinese pirates
was old Moy Sen, a rich Chinaman who lived in a
handsome home in Canton and posed as a legitimate
trader. He owned a large fleet of junks and one
steamer, and there was not a ship that left Hong
Kong with a rich cargo that he did not know all about.
The evil genius of the Malays was a shrewd scoundrel
known as Leandrio, and he and Moy Sen
operated under what would be known to-day as a
“gentlemen’s agreement,” by which they divided up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the territory, in a general way, and did not interfere
with each other. As a matter of fact there were
practically no honest trading ships in that section,
with the exception of the big merchantmen engaged
in the export trade. All of the coasting ships were
either pirates themselves, when the conditions were
favorable, or were in league with the pirates, to whom
they carried information as to the value of cargoes
being prepared for shipment and their probable date
of departure. The result was that there was not a
ship, except the easily distinguished merchantman,
which we did not come to regard as legitimate prey.</p>

<p>Norton argued that the pirates were bound to keep
on robbing and burning and murdering in spite of
anything we could do, and that we could derive
plenty of excitement and large profits by robbing
them. Incidentally, he contended, we would put a
lot of them out of business for good and all, thus contributing
to the end desired by all nations. I fell in
with his plan heartily, for, while I cared little for the
money that was to be made, it promised as lively
adventures as I could wish for. It was arranged that
I should pose as Dr. Burnet, a rich English physician
who was cruising in his private yacht for his health.
To make it appear that they were engaged in legitimate
commerce, the “Florence” and “Surprise”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
were to carry some general cargoes from port to port
among the islands but were to so shape their cruises
that they would be at certain fixed points on or about
given dates, so that we could keep closely in touch
with them. They were to be given large crews and
so heavily armed as to be safe from piratical attacks.
The “Leckwith” was to do all of the preying on the
pirates and the loot we took from them was to be
turned over to the other ships at the meeting places.
This would make it unnecessary for us to put into
port often as we could use our sails a great deal
and husband our coal. This arrangement, and the
changes which could quickly be made in the rig of all
the ships, would, we figured, remove us from suspicion,
for a long time at least. Agencies for our legitimate
cargoes were established in Sumatra, on the
island of Banca, where there were extensive tin mines,
in Borneo and Rajah Brooke’s independent government
of Sarawak in North Borneo, and at other convenient
places. It was arranged that the bulk of our
loot should be sent to a firm of Chinamen at Singapore,
who dealt largely in dishonest cargoes but were
absolutely honest with their clients.</p>

<p>With the schedules of the “Florence” and “Surprise”
established and with the “Leckwith’s” bunkers
stuffed with coal, we headed for the islands in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
search of pirates. We then had a crew of about
seventy-five men, though at different times we had as
few as fifty and as many as one hundred, independent
of the “black gang” in the fire and engine rooms.
The crews of the three ships were frequently interchanged,
except for about fifteen especially brave and
reckless fellows who were always kept on the “Leckwith.”
With all of our sails set and in the guise of a
trading ship we sometimes trapped the pirates into
coming alongside and grappling with us, which made
it easy work for us, but when we had reason to think
they had valuable booty on board we went at them
full tilt under steam and took it away from them. All
of our guns, which were always unshipped when we
went into port, were close up against the rail and
were concealed under what looked like deck cargo,
but it was the work of only a moment to cast off their
covering and lower a section of the bulwarks long
enough to give them a wide radius of action.</p>

<p>Our first experience was a profitable one. When
near the “hunting grounds” we lowered the smokestack,
got up our canvas, and sailed along awaiting
developments. We were getting in among the islands
when we met a big junk which had just looted and
scuttled a richly laden Brazilian barkentine. She had
much more than enough on board to pay her for one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
trip, but cupidity got the better of her commander
and he put about and came after us, thinking we were
only a trading schooner but might have something
on board worth taking. We made a pretence of trying
to get away, which we could have done, for the
“Leckwith” footed fast even under sail, but in reality
we eased our sheets to hasten matters along. When
he was close astern of us, with the wind abeam, we
luffed up, got out guns ready for action in a jiffy and,
as we crossed his bows, raked him fore and aft with
our carronades, which were loaded almost to the
muzzle with slugs and nails. Before he could change
his course, with his decks littered with dead and
mangled, we came about and gave him a broadside at
close quarters, along with a deadly rifle fire from the
hitherto unseen members of the crew who had been
concealed in the ’tween decks. He replied to this
blast with a lot of stink-pots, only a few of which
came aboard and were tossed into the sea before any
ill effects were felt from their nauseating fumes, and
a weak and poorly directed fire from his guns. Taken
completely by surprise and with more than half of
their number littering the reddened deck, the pirates
were panic-stricken. Before they could regain their
senses we came about again and gave them another
broadside which took all the fight out of them, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
there had been any left, and put them at our mercy.
As we ranged alongside, keeping up a rifle fire but
disdaining any further use of our guns, they managed
to launch a couple of boats and all who could get into
them pulled for the nearest island. When we threw
our grappling irons and hauled in on them the few
survivors who had strength enough left to get to the
rail threw themselves overboard and swam for it.
The first man aboard of the junk had one of his legs
almost severed by the wicked sword of a badly
wounded Chinaman, and after that bit of fiendishness
our men lost no time in making sure that the rest of
them were really dead. We took out of the junk fully
one hundred thousand dollars’ worth of specie, silk,
tea, porcelain, and drugs and then set fire to her, leaving
her to bury her own dead.</p>

<p>After that easily won victory we trapped and sank
half a dozen proas and feluccas in the same way,
though with more spirited resistance in some cases,
for we were so anxious to get things to going
that we threw off our mask before we had them at
such close quarters as we got the junk. We had two
men killed in these engagements and a dozen more
or less seriously injured. Norton sustained an ugly
cut on the leg that sent him to the hospital and I got
a slash on the arm that gave me considerable trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
for a few days. In only one instance did a ship get
away from us and that was when two proas attacked
us on either side in a dead calm that settled
before we could get steam up. We could not change
our position, while they manœuvred with their long
oars and one of them escaped, though she took a lot
of dead with her. We got nothing from them to speak
of but there was excitement <i>in extenso</i> and we gloried
in it. Norton had not overdrawn the picture of the
adventurous China Sea.</p>

<p>We had turned our cargo over to the “Florence,”
along with a number of wounded men, and were back
among the islands, though outside of the regular
course of sailing ships, when early one evening a
full-rigged ship hove in sight. She passed us but was
not more than six miles away when we saw flashes
that told us she had been attacked. We had our fires
banked, for it was just at the break of the monsoon
when the weather is variable and the winds uncertain,
so we lost no time in going to her assistance. As
we closed in we saw a Malay felucca on each side
of her and the pirates swarming on her decks, with
the crew putting up a brave fight. Running the
“Leckwith” up on her starboard quarter, we threw
our men aboard of her and they went at the pirates
savagely from the rear. I led the boarding party for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
it looked as though it would be one of the kind of
fights that I never would miss. In those days I was
young, athletic, and vigorous and I had rather have a
fight with death at one end of it than anything else.
No matter where I went, or what the odds against us,
I knew the men of the “Leckwith” would be at my
heels, for a braver set of dare-devils never lived.</p>

<p>The Malays outnumbered us more than two to one,
but we went at them with a fury that was new to
them, and were slowly forcing them back toward
their one good boat—we had smashed the other one
to bits when we slammed alongside—when a beautiful
white yacht came tearing up on the port quarter
and sent three boatloads of men to our assistance in
such smart style that I took her to be a gunboat,
though the quick glance I took at her showed her
lines to be unusually fine for a warship. Her party
clambered over the bows under command of a stockily
built young officer wearing what looked like the uniform
of a naval captain, and we had the pirates
between us. I understood later, when I learned who
and what they were, why these reinforcements, instead
of discouraging the Malays, caused them to
fight with renewed desperation. But they could not
withstand our combined rush and the last of them
soon went over the side into their proa, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
drifted away into the darkness when they cut her
loose. However, in the last few minutes of fighting
the young British officer, as I took him to be, sustained
a savage cut in his right shoulder, and after we
had laid aside our dead and given our wounded rough
attention I was surprised to receive an inquiry from
him as to whether we had a surgeon on board. I
replied that I was a surgeon and, taking him aboard
the “Leckwith,” dressed his wound on the cabin
table. I then saw that his uniform was that of a
captain, but not of a naval officer. He told me his
name was Deverell but when I asked him the name of
his ship he answered evasively, and I had learned the
ways of the China Sea too well to press the question.</p>

<p>“Your wound is rather a bad one,” I told him,
“and is likely to require further attention. I am
simply loafing and expect to be cruising in this neighborhood
for some time, even though it does seem to
be pretty thick with pirates. I will be glad to have
you call on me if I can be of any service to you.”</p>

<p>He mystified me still more when he replied: “We
know you, Doctor, and will know where to find you if
it becomes necessary to take further advantage of
your kindness.”</p>

<p>I had not time just then to think much about the
strange incident, for the fight had been a bloody one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
and there were many men who needed attention. We
had six men killed and there were fully twenty-five
more with injuries of some sort. When I came to
look myself over I found that one bullet had grazed
the top of my head and another my chest, while the
right shoulder of my jacket had been sliced off by a
cut that, had it been properly placed, would have
taken my arm with it. My only injury was a trifling
flesh wound on my leg. Had I been less of a fatalist
narrow escapes of that kind, to which I grew accustomed,
might have affected my nerves, but instead
they were only entertaining. It interested me, in
every fight, to see just how close I had come to being
killed, knowing full well that death could not add my
name to the list until my time came, and that then
there would be no way of avoiding it.</p>

<p>When we got to clearing up the decks nearly sixty
dead Malays were thrown overboard. The merchantman,
which was an English bark, had twelve of her
crew killed and so many of the survivors were badly
cut up that only six men were fit for duty. We left
enough of our men on board to work the ship and
convoyed her to within two hundred miles of Singapore,
where, with a fair wind and a smooth sea, she
was able to proceed without danger. That episode
netted us not only a glorious fight but a great reputation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
as the friend and protector of honest shipping.
In fact, it brought us too much fame, for when we put
into Labuan, a British island off the north coast of
Borneo, for coal, after seeing the merchantman safely
on her way, and reported the incident, we had to get
out in a hurry to avoid a lot of innocent questions as
to who Dr. Burnet was and where he came from.</p>

<p>On our way back to the islands from Labuan we
sighted the mysterious yacht whose commander I
had attended. Evidently she was looking for us for
she changed her course as soon as she made us out,
and sent a boat alongside with a request that I come
aboard, as the captain was very ill. I found him suffering
with surgical fever, as I had predicted, and in
rather a bad way. I dressed his wound and treated
him and stood by for three or four days, visiting him
twice a day and returning immediately to the “Leckwith,”
for while my services were plainly appreciated
it seemed that I was not wanted on the strange ship
any longer than was necessary. There was an air of
mystery about her that puzzled and fascinated me.
As I entered Deverell’s cabin on my first visit I
thought I heard the rustle of a skirt in the passageway
behind me. Before I could make any inquiry
Deverell, as though reading my mind, requested me
to ask him no questions about anything relating to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
the ship. On my last visit, when I told him he needed
no further attention, he said, after thanking me, “I
am master here and I am not. No doubt things seem
strange to you, and they really are stranger than you
think, but I cannot tell you more now. Fate seems to
have thrown us together, however, and I believe we
shall see more of each other and get better acquainted.
I hope so. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Cruising westward after parting company with the
ship of mystery we ran right into a series of profitable
engagements. Four ships had left Hong Kong together
but only one got through. The booty which
the pirates took from the others we captured from
them, in two small junks and three large proas, which
we destroyed. We transferred our cargo to the
“Florence,” near South Natuna Island, and stood off
to the north while she headed for Singapore. We
were three or four hours away from her when I had a
strange presentiment that I should have stayed with
her. The feeling was so strong that I put the “Leckwith”
about, caught up with her, and went on board,
with my traps. Expecting to have a lot of idle time
I took along my torpedo, with which I was still experimenting.</p>

<p>A week later we were in a particularly dangerous
place, near where the Brazilian barkentine had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
scuttled. Late in the afternoon as we entered a narrow
passage, we sighted a big proa close to an island on
the port bow, and less than half a mile farther on we
came on another one partly hidden in the mouth of
a creek in a larger island on the starboard hand.
There was not a sign of life on either one of them
but I knew their crews were close by and felt that
we were in for it. I was fussing with the torpedo
when we came upon them and it struck me that this
would be a good chance to put it to the test, if both
of them attacked us at once, which I supposed they
would do. We had neither fulminate of mercury nor
gun-cotton aboard but I had been working to overcome
that very difficulty and had arranged the firing
pin so that it would discharge a cartridge into an
explosive charge of black powder. We packed the
chamber with powder, and filled enough air cylinders to
keep the torpedo afloat, bent on a towing line of new
manila rope, one hundred fathoms long, and had
everything in readiness by the time it was dark.</p>

<p>We kept a sharp lookout and it was not long until
we heard the soft <i>chug</i> of oars off the starboard bow.
Our whaleboat, which was manned and waiting, at
once set off in a course which, we figured, would carry
the towing line across the bow of the proa. A few
minutes later we made out the other proa coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
up astern on the port side. The pair of them got so
close that it looked as though something had gone
wrong with my torpedo and I was just about to divide
our crew to meet them on both sides when there was
a flash and a roar less than fifty yards away, and the
complete success of my invention was demonstrated.
The proa was thrown out of the water, turned over,
and badly smashed up. We never knew how many of
her crew were killed by the explosion but not many
could have escaped. The other craft swung around
to board us but we riddled it with full charges from
the fore and aft carronades and it began to sink. The
survivors took to the water and a lot of them attacked
the whaleboat, which had towed the torpedo, as it was
making its way back to the ship. The boat’s crew
were prepared for them and their heavy cutlasses
chopped off every hand that grasped the gunwale and
split open every head they could reach.</p>

<p>At Singapore, where we discharged our cargo, our
agents reported that Moy Sen was vowing vengeance
on us for the loot we had wrested from him and the
havoc we had spread among his fleet, and that he had
caused the report to be actively circulated at Hong
Kong that the “Leckwith” was not a private yacht
but a pirate, preying on legitimate commerce. As a
result many robberies with which we had nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
at all to do were being laid at our door, and we were
advised to be cautious. We worked our way back to
the rendezvous and, after consulting with Norton,
I took my interpreter, Ah Fen, who was half
“Chinkie” and half Malay, from the “Leckwith”
and went to Hong Kong on the “Surprise” to see
just what was going on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>“THE BEAUTIFUL WHITE DEVIL”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“THE Beautiful White Devil,” a woman pirate
whom I at first regarded as a purely fanciful
being, born of the unreal atmosphere of the East, came
into my life, in which she was destined to play a most
important part, at Hong Kong in the early days of
1876. I had gone there in search of authentic information
concerning the attitude and plans of old
Moy Sen, overlord of all the Chinese pirates, who was
reported to have declared an intention to bury my
harassing ships and all on board of them, in return
for our vigorous operations against him. This threat
had given a new interest to a game of which I was
beginning to tire, for I had then been waging war on
the pirates for more than a year, and it was getting
monotonous. I landed quietly at night from the
“Surprise,” which remained far out in the roadstead,
and went to the old Queen’s Hotel, where I clung to
my role of a rich English physician, travelling for
his health, but assumed a new name, which I cannot
recall. My “Chinkie” interpreter, Ah Fen, I sent
on up to Canton to secretly gain such information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
as he could pick up from a relative in the camp
of the boss buccaneer of the China Sea.</p>

<p>While waiting for his report I lounged around the
hotel and steered my casual conversation with the
<i>habitués</i> toward the subject in which I was most
interested. Soon I began to hear weird stories of a
woman pirate who, while never molesting honest
merchantmen, preyed mercilessly and successfully on
the Chinese and Malay pirates, just as Norton and I
were doing. It was said that she was exquisitely
beautiful of face and diabolically black of heart; that
she led her band of cut-throats in person and gloried
in the shedding of black and yellow blood by the
barrel. Her recreation from wholesale butchery was
found in the companionship of occasional white men
whom she ran across and who gladly accompanied
her to her retreat, located no one knew where, only
to be killed when she wearied of them. According to
these tales, which I at first regarded as purely imaginative,
she travelled in a steam yacht of phenomenal
speed and had never failed in her desperate exploits.
Though she had been in the business for years no one
in Hong Kong had ever seen her and she was known
only as the “Beautiful White Devil,” which name,
from all accounts, was well suited to her. It occurred
to me at once that if such a woman really did exist it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
might have been her ship that came to our assistance
on the night of our battle with the Malays on the
deck of the British bark, and whose captain I had
attended under strange circumstances, and I saw
visions of a meeting and perhaps closer acquaintance
with her; but they were only fleeting fancies, for I
could not make myself believe the tales that were
told me. Not but what I wanted to believe them, and
tried to, for next to adventure I loved a beautiful
woman; if the two could be combined, the result would
be an absolutely ideal condition, even though the
feminine fancy did run to murder; but my reason told
me I was dreaming of the impossible.</p>

<p>However, after I had heard the report of Ah Fen,
who returned in about two weeks, bubbling over with
information and gossip, I put more confidence in what
I had been told, for he repeated the same wild story,
with elaborations and variations. It was a well established
fact in the minds of Moy Sen and his followers,
he said, that there actually was a woman pirate who
preyed on and destroyed the regular pirates, and she
was as much hated as we were, or more, for she had
been following that calling, with much energy, for
years. It was said she had inherited an avenging oath
against the pirates from some male member of her
family, who had been a terror to them before her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
and she was carrying it out with fanatical fervor.
This was the story brought in by pirates who had
escaped from junks and proas she had attacked,
and who gave thrilling accounts of her demoniacal
fury in leading her men. Moy Sen, my interpreter
reported, was swearing renewed vengeance on both
of us but, inasmuch as the lady seemed to bear a
charmed life, he proposed to go after me first. He
attributed to me the destruction of some of his junks
that I had never seen, while, to balance accounts, the
robbery of some of his ships which I had looted was
laid at the door of my woman contemporary. This
convinced me that there was a woman pirate, or,
which I still believed to be more likely, a man masquerading
as a woman, and that the pirate chief had
confused our exploits. He was setting some sort of a
trap for me, according to the inside gossip picked up
by Ah Fen, and was determined to sweep the sea
clear of my ships, at least.</p>

<p>I had sent the “Surprise” away as soon as she
landed me, with orders to return in a month, ostensibly
in search of cargo, and pick me up. She was
about due when a man called at my hotel one evening
and asked if an English physician was stopping there.
I was pointed out to him in the billiard room and as
he came toward me I recognized Captain Deverell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
but he was as formal as a stranger and I took my
cue from that and did not indicate that I knew him.
He asked if he could consult with me and I took him
to my room, where he assumed a much more cordial
air.</p>

<p>“I called,” he said, “to invite you to take a cruise
with me so that we may get better acquainted and I
can show you my appreciation of your kindness of a
few weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“How long will you be out?” I asked.</p>

<p>“A week or a month; whatever time suits your
pleasure.”</p>

<p>I did some quick thinking. If there was a woman
pirate it was her ship that Deverell commanded, I
was sure. If I accepted his invitation I might go
the way of other men whom, if the reports I had heard
were to be trusted, she had picked up, and who never
returned. Whether she was a “Devil” or whether
it was her ship from which the invitation came I could
not ask without showing some apprehension that
would be impolite. Besides, I had previously been
requested by Deverell to ask him no questions about
himself or his ship and I inferred that this inhibition
was still in force; if he had wanted me to know more
than he had indicated he would have volunteered the
information. It was an uncanny proceeding, yet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
very mystery of it attracted me as a magnet does
steel. Furthermore, here was a brand new adventure,
right within my grasp, and if it was to end my career
then it was because my time had come, and that was
all there was to it.</p>

<p>With my thoughts running in that channel a decision
was quickly reached and I told Deverell I would
be glad to go with him. I packed my bag and turned
it over to a man whom Deverell summoned from the
street. Ah Fen was instructed to watch for the “Surprise,”
rejoin the “Leckwith,” and report to Norton
what he had told me, and tell him to have me picked
up at Hong Kong in a month or six weeks. Late in
the evening we went to the Bund where a boat that
was waiting at an out-of-the-way landing up near
the native quarter took us out to the ship, which was
lying fully six miles offshore, well beyond the usual
anchorage. It was the same ship I had seen several
times before but her rig had been so altered, by taking
the rake out of her stack and shortening her spars,
and by changing her upper works, that I could not
have recognized her if I had seen her under any other
conditions. Her sides were discolored and dirty, due
to the skilful use of paint, and she looked like an old
tramp. But on board of her were all the comforts
and conveniences of a yacht, with the discipline of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
warship. She was about the size of the “Leckwith,”
registering probably five hundred tons net, and with
the removal of her dummy superstructure which concealed
six carronades, her deck was clear, except for
the wheelhouse and the captain’s room behind it.
The gun deck below was devoted entirely to living
quarters arranged with an eye to comfort. Those for
the crew ran back to amidships, for she carried all of
a hundred men. Abaft of them were the officers’
quarters and in the stern, cut off from the rest of the
ship, were the rooms of the real commander, which
were large and sumptuously furnished.</p>

<p>As soon as we were on board it was “Up anchor
and full speed to sea.” Appropriately enough, I was
given the cabin of the surgeon, who had died recently,
to which fact I owed my presence on the ship. Deverell
took me into his room and we talked until
midnight. Soon after we got under way he satisfied
my silent impatience by throwing open a panel and
exposing a life-size painting of the most beautiful
woman I had ever seen.</p>

<p>“Is that the Beautiful White Devil?” I asked,
unable longer to restrain the questions that were
choking me.</p>

<p>“That is our Queen,” he replied gravely, “and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
by that name alone that she is known to us and
spoken of on this ship.”</p>

<p>“She certainly is entitled to the first part of the
name by which she is known ashore, whether or not
she deserves the last section of it,” I said, with open
admiration.</p>

<p>His answer left no doubt as to whose ship I was on.
“That picture may do partial justice to her face but
it is impossible that it could portray the beauty of her
heart. Instead of being cold-blooded and bloodthirsty,
as you seem to have heard, she is tender and
sympathetic and she has devoted a great part of her
money to the relief of suffering humanity. She deprecates
killing even villainous Malays and Chinks, but
she will not be defeated, cost what it will. Never
since I joined the ship have I seen a wanton act of
cruelty.”</p>

<p>“What is her life, and what is the motive of it?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“She will have to tell you that herself, but before
you see her I want to warn you. Every man who
sees the Queen falls in love with her, and if you think
you are going to be like the rest you had better go
over the side right now.”</p>

<p>“How is one to keep from falling in love with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
her?” I inquired, with some anxiety, still lost in admiration
of the lovely face on the canvas.</p>

<p>“If one philosophizes and keeps his love to himself
it is all right, but this lady is not to be won by any
man. She has devoted her life to a particular purpose
and we have devoted our lives to her.”</p>

<p>“That sounds very romantic and interesting,” I
observed, already half suspicious that Deverell himself
was in love with her. “What is the special purpose
to which you are all pledged?”</p>

<p>A shrug of the shoulders and a smile made up the
only answer.</p>

<p>Deverell then closed the panel and made me the
subject of conversation. He asked all manner of
questions about my life, and when I brought the story
down to the China Sea he showed a familiarity with
my movements which indicated a system of spies that
aroused my admiration, and I was free in expressing
it. It was through their elaborate system, he admitted,
that they had learned I was in Hong Kong
and where I was stopping. He admitted, too, that
they had been in touch with me from the day I entered
their waters and had come to regard me as a
kindred soul, to which fact I owed my invitation from
their Queen.</p>

<p>It was considerably after eight bells before I retired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
but my sleep was not long or heavy, for the strangeness
of the situation and its possibilities impressed
me, not with fear but with exultant expectancy. At
breakfast time Deverell, wearing a smart uniform,
escorted me aft to the private quarters of the Queen,
which reminded me of those of an officer of flag rank
in the American Navy. They had the same private
galley and air of exclusiveness of a flagship, but they
were much more spacious and were fitted out with a
daintiness that bespoke generations of culture. The
dining-room was a reproduction in miniature of those
one finds in the best homes of England, with nothing
about it to suggest the sea. Back of it and separated
from it by odd Chinese curtains, was a luxurious
lounging room, with large ports cut through the over-hang.
On one side of it was the Queen’s sitting-room
and library, and on the other her boudoir.</p>

<p>I was ushered into the dining-room and in a
moment the Queen appeared. As she parted the curtains
and paused for just an instant in the doorway
with an air of diffidence, I was transfixed by her
marvellous beauty, to which, as Deverell had said, the
painted picture had done only partial justice. Tall,
and with the figure and the manner of a goddess, I
was fascinated by her eyes, deep blue and filled with
sentiment and sympathy; eyes that could never be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
brutal but which must yearn for love and tenderness;
not the eyes of a woman born to command, for there
was a softness about them that was almost pleading,
but of one created with a desire to be herself commanded
and dominated by a stronger nature.
Through them she looked at me as a child might
look, but with more of understanding, yet as much of
curiosity. Unconfined, her hair, when I saw it, would
have swept the floor, but it was twisted into a great
black, glistening crown; a little detail that made her
appear more than ever the Queen.</p>

<p>Deverell started to introduce me but she interrupted
him. “I already know Dr. Burnet,” she said,
as she swept toward me with superb grace and infinite
charm of manner and extended her hand, small
and soft.</p>

<p>“And I feel that I already know you” was a
blunder into which her eyes led me.</p>

<p>Instantly the look of animation which had come
into her wonderful eyes gave way to one of sadness.
“But I fear,” she said, “that the reports you have
heard regarding me are very different from those I
have had concerning you, and which caused me to
want to meet you, that I might thank you for your
kindness to Captain Deverell.”</p>

<p>I stumbled into another tactless reply: “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
only one fault to find with what I have been told.
You should be known as ‘The Beautiful White
Angel.’” It was not a polite thing to say but I was
hopelessly, almost heedlessly, in love, and it always
has been my way to go straight at things.</p>

<p>Her answer, only through her eyes, that if I was
not, in fact, a very ordinary individual I had made a
very commonplace remark, so added to my embarrassment
that we had talked about the weather and
the sea for some time before I got back to my mooring
and felt reasonably secure. Before breakfast was
over we were getting along better, though I could
not have concealed the admiration I did not express.
At the end of the meal the Queen and I retired to
the lounging room, Deverell going forward to look
after the ship. His attitude toward her was one of
devotion that amounted almost to homage, which she
accepted as her right, and he spoke of and to her only
as “Queen.” Naturally, I addressed her in the same
way, as that was the only name Deverell had used
when he started to introduce me, and I then knew her
by no other.</p>

<p>“We are headed for my retreat,” she explained. “I
want you to see it, and your visit there will give us an
opportunity to get better acquainted. I should like to
have you stay with us as long as you can. I will put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
you down in Hong Kong or Singapore on three or
four days’ notice.”</p>

<p>I assured her the prospect was delightful. With a
bow and a smile that encouraged veritable loquacity
she asked me to tell her all about myself, and she
displayed so much interest in my different filibustering
expeditions, and the adventures that grew out of
them, that I gradually told her the whole story.
When my recital brought me to the China Sea her
interest became even more lively, as to details, but
she displayed the same intimate knowledge of my
movements, in a general way, that Deverell had
shown.</p>

<p>In the course of the numerous long talks which
followed, I felt that I was regaining some of the
ground I had lost by my blunders in my first bewilderment,
and though my infatuation grew stronger
every time I was in her magnetic presence, which
charged my whole being with the electrical energy
of life at its best, I said not another word to her
about it, on the ship. As we came to understand
each other better she asked me to tell her all I had
heard about her. I was surprised, but I knew she
meant me to be perfectly frank with her, so I
repeated, in a general way, the vague and vapory
whisperings as to her wonderful beauty, on the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
hand, and her alleged bloodthirstiness and wantonness
on the other, which latter stories, I told her,
could not be tolerated for an instant by any one who
had ever seen her. She smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>“I never have cared what people said or thought
of me,” she said very slowly, “until recently. Far
from enjoying the life I have been compelled to lead,
I have suffered from it. It has been hard, and I
have had to face and solve its problems alone. Craving
friendship as flowers do the sun, and needing it
as much, I have had to cut myself off from the world
and try to make myself believe that I have neither
heart nor conscience. When we get home I will tell
you the story of my life, as you have told me yours.”</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the third day out from Hong
Kong we ran into a group of islands, off to the eastward
of the regular course to Singapore. Just as
dinner was announced a flag was waved from the
bridge and, following Deverell’s eyes, I made out an
answering signal on the steep side of a small island
just ahead of us. We were close inshore and I
scanned the bank closely but could see no sign of
either a landing or an opening. I was anxious to see
what was to follow but a messenger brought word that
the Queen was waiting dinner for me. Deverell did
not dine with us but joined us as we were having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
coffee. The ship slowed down while we were at dinner
and finally the screw stopped. Immediately the
Queen led the way to the deck, where she had ordered
coffee served.</p>

<p>“This,” she said at the head of the stairway, “is
my kingdom—without a king. Isn’t it beautiful?”</p>

<p>I was a little in doubt as to whether her inquiry
related to the scenery or the absence of a male ruler,
but, without being able to distinguish clearly in the
gathering tropic darkness, I assured her that it was
the most beautiful place I had ever seen, wherein,
when day dawned, I found I had not exaggerated.
We were at the head of an oval lake, perhaps a mile
and a half long, with mountains, whose ascent began
close to the shore, rising crescent-shaped around it.
There was a small village, composed of English cottages
and native huts, at the end of the lake nearest
to us. On three sides of the lake was a narrow beach,
which widened at the village; the fourth side, toward
the sea, was a perpendicular bluff, sixty feet or more
high. I searched it for the passage through which
we had entered the lake but nothing could I see but
a bare wall of dark rock. The Queen watched me
as I studied the situation and smiled at my perplexity.
“Wait until to-morrow,” she laughed. “It
would never do to let you into all of our secrets at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
once. You had best retire early, for we will go
ashore at sunrise,” and she disappeared.</p>

<p>While we had been talking the topmasts were
lowered, which I did not quite understand, and the
fires drawn, and soon I was alone on deck, with a
solitary watchman forward. There was no moon but
under the soft light of the stars, low-hung and with
a brilliancy seen only at or near the equator, I sat
in silent wonder and admiration for hours. I was
up again before it was full daylight and watched the
lowering of the Queen’s launch. She appeared with
the sun, accompanied by a Dyak woman whom I had
not seen before, and we landed at a little stone dock
in front of the village. All of the inhabitants, consisting
of about fifty English and Scotch men and
women, some with silvered locks and bent backs,
and some of them crippled by the pirates, and nearly
as many natives, crowded the pier to meet her, their
manner one of the greatest affection and deference.
We walked through the village, which was a model of
neatness, and on up a winding path for nearly a mile,
when a sharp turn around a flank of the mountain
brought us to a large bungalow—the palace of the
Queen. It was so situated that it could not be seen
from the sea, at any point, but just around the turn
and not fifty yards from the house was a deep shadowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
bower from which there was a clear view of
the ocean for two-thirds of the way around the compass.
This was the outside sitting-room of the
Queen and here breakfast was served. While it was
being prepared she made herself more beautiful by
changing her dress of European style for a native
costume of flowing silk so becoming that I wondered
at her ever wearing anything else.</p>

<p>After breakfast she looked down at the little town
and far out to sea in silence for a long time, and then
told me the story of her life. Her name, she said, was
Katherine Crofton. Her father was one of the
younger branches of a family which was headed by a
Baron. The family crest was a sheaf of wheat and
the motto “God grants the increase.” Her branch
of the family had lived in the south of Ireland for
several generations. Another branch had long lived
at Derry Willow in the County Leitrim. Her father
was a lieutenant commander in the British Navy
and to prevent an accident he disobeyed the order of
an incompetent and arrogant superior officer. In a
quarrel that followed her father knocked his superior
down and otherwise abused him, for which he was
court-martialled and dismissed.</p>

<p>“My father was a high-spirited man,” she continued,
“and his disgrace embittered him against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
England and everything English. He soon left home,
without saying where he was going, and when we
next heard from him he was in Hong Kong. He corresponded
with us regularly after that and in three
or four years, when I was about fifteen, he wrote
mother and me to take a P &amp; O ship for Singapore,
where we would find further instructions. When we
got there father was waiting for us on a handsome
yacht, the ‘Queen,’ which is the ship that you have
heard so much about. I am still using her. He
brought us to this island, which he had fitted out as
a retreat. He had established a small settlement
down on the lake and built a warehouse in which to
store his goods, and a machine shop to facilitate
repairs to his ship. He had taken great pains and
put himself to a large expense to make his rendezvous
secure from intrusion or discovery.</p>

<p>“Evidently this lake is in the crater of an old volcano
which, when it subsided, left a high, narrow barrier
between it and its old enemy, the sea. Down
there,” pointing to the end of the lake opposite the
village, “was a narrow opening into the lake, with a
deep channel leading straight out to sea, though on
both sides of it are rocks and shoals. Probably it was
a fissure created by the volcano; anyway it served my
father’s purpose perfectly. He had the opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
closed up with rocks until it was just wide enough to
admit the ‘Queen.’ The ridge there, you can see, is
not more than thirty-five or forty feet high, so the
partial closing of the gap was really not such a difficult
task. Then he fitted into the opening that was
left, a great double gate, which rolls back and forth,
instead of opening outward, and though it weighs
many tons its mechanism is so arranged that four
men can operate it. The gate is strong enough to
stand any storm but to avoid straining it we keep it
open in heavy weather, unless ships are hovering
about. From a watch tower on top of the mountain
behind us we get a clear view of the sea in all directions,
and a man is always on duty there. The ridge
that cuts off the ocean rises toward the upper end of
the lake and the village is entirely hidden behind it,
as is the ‘Queen’ when her topmasts are housed.
The island, as you can see, is very small and from
the sea there is not a sign to indicate that it is inhabited.
When the gate at the opening into the lake is
closed it cannot be distinguished at a distance of an
eighth of a mile, for it exactly resembles the rocks
on both sides of it, but the channel which leads to it
is known to no one save us and no other ship would
dare to venture within a mile and a half of the shore
on account of the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“I did not understand at first the meaning of all
of these precautions, or some other things. Father
went out on frequent voyages and returned with more
or less cargo, which was placed in the warehouse, until
it was full. Then father would change the appearance
of his ship so that no one would know her and
take cargoes out and sell them, until the warehouse
was empty again. He always took mother and me
along on these trips, though never on the others, and
young as I was I learned much about navigation, for
I had his love for the sea. On these trips we brought
back books and magazines and so were able to keep a
little in touch with the outside world.</p>

<p>“When I was not much older than nineteen father
and mother were taken desperately ill and, believing
that he would not recover, he called me into his room
and made a confession. He said that in his hatred of
the British he had turned pirate and had been for all
those years preying on ships flying the flag he
despised. He had also, occasionally, waged war on
the native pirates and taken their loot from them,
which explained why he had frequently come in with
wounded men on board. He told me of how he had
suffered from the act of injustice which expelled him
from the navy and in the end he made me swear that
if he died I would continue the work he had begun.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
He told me I could rely on Frank Deverell, his chief
officer, whom he said he hoped I would some day
marry,”—this last with just a trace of sarcasm. “My
father died the next week and my mother three
months later.</p>

<p>“That was four years ago. I have kept the oath
which my love for my father prompted me to take,
but the fulfilment of it has brought me increasing
misery. My attacks on the British flag have been
few—in fact I have given timely assistance to many
more English ships than I have robbed, and hundreds
of their passengers and sailors owe their lives to me,
but I have preyed on the natural pirates of these
waters as ardently, perhaps, as did my father. Yet I
have no greater moral right to take from them what
they have stolen than I have to rob a British or an
American ship, nor can I excuse myself for the loss
of life that goes with my attacks on them. I am
much better armed than they are and it is nothing
but cowardice, as well as thievery, for me to make
war on them. I am, in fact, no better than they are,
for I am in the same class with them—a pirate. My
conscience has troubled me more and more until it
has sickened me with the whole wretched business.
A bad promise is better broken than kept; an oath
is no more than a promise; and I am about ready to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
quit all of this robbery and butchery and try to return
to decency and civilization. As to the other stories
you have heard about me—they are simply lies.”</p>

<p>Toward the end she spoke rapidly and passionately
and when she finished she was all a-quiver, and her
eyes filled with tears. After a long pause, during
which she regained control of herself, she said:</p>

<p>“Now, Captain, I have told you all. I am partly
justified, if such a vow as mine can be pleaded as justification,
but why are you in this business?”</p>

<p>Her sudden inquiry, following her bitter denunciation
of pirates and those who preyed on them, surprised
and embarrassed me. I told her that I was in
it only because of the adventure of it; that I had
been attracted to the China Sea by Norton’s stories,
and that once there I had naturally fallen in with the
exciting life and become a part of it; and that all of
my fighting blood was aroused and my soul glorified
by the fact that the great pirate chief had sworn to
crush me.</p>

<p>“That is not a sufficient excuse,” she replied,
promptly and decisively. “I had some reason for my
actions, but you have none.” A moment later she
added, gently: “I did not mean to pass judgment on
you, for I have no right to do that. We must all be
governed by our own consciences.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Neither one of us cared to continue the conversation
and I was glad when she suggested that she
would have a servant show me to a smaller bungalow,
a short distance away, where I was to stay, though
taking my meals at the “palace.” She advised a walk
through the village and around the lake during the
forenoon, and said we would walk toward the top of
the mountain after lunch. I looked over my comfortable
quarters and then walked back to the lake
and went in a boat, with Deverell and Fennell, the
“Queen’s” second officer, to the entrance, in which I
was much interested. I found it to be just as it had
been described. There were two gates, one on each
side, about twenty-five feet high, above low water,
and fifteen feet wide. They ran on small wheels in
grooves cut in the solid rock and had been put in
place, evidently, by building a cofferdam around the
entrance. Below the water line they were built of
heavy iron lattice work, so as to give the tides free
ingress and egress. Above the water they were constructed
of thick timbers, covered on the seaward side
with iron plates. When they were open they ran
back into nests cut into granite rock. When they
were closed they came together diagonally, in the
shape of a wide V, with the apex facing outward, so
that the action of the waves only locked them more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
firmly. It was possible for two men to operate each
gate, though six made quicker work of it. Their construction
was as fine a piece of elusive engineering
as I have ever seen. Their height was so arranged
that there was no break in the coast line and they
were, as the Queen had said, indistinguishable at a
very short distance. There was just room enough
over the sill to admit the “Queen” at low tide, and
a larger ship could not have gotten through the gates
or over the bar.</p>

<p>I told Deverell enough to make him understand,
without my saying so, that the Queen had told me
her life story, and, knowing this, he talked quite
freely. From what he said I satisfied myself that not
only had the elder Crofton been an out-and-out pirate
but his bewitching daughter had done honor to his
name, for two or three years at least. We visited the
machine shop, which was quite elaborately fitted up
for the repair of ship and guns, and walked through
the village, where he pointed out men who had lost
arms or legs in the service of the Queen and her
father, and others who had been retired for age and
were now pensioners. Deverell was a true pirate and
told me with delight of some of their exploits. His
reverence for the Queen amounted to idolatry. If his
love for her had been returned I would not have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
surprised for, though lacking some of the finer
instincts of a gentleman, as could well be imagined
from his surroundings for years, he was an unusually
likable chap and of a type that ordinarily appeals
strongly to women. He was about forty years old,
two inches less than six feet tall, and had the figure
of an Apollo. His steel gray eyes sparkled with
friendship or shot sparks, and his brown hair fairly
bristled when he was angry. He impressed one as
being altogether a man, the soul of loyalty, a perfect
friend, and brave to the last drop of his blood.</p>

<p>After luncheon the Queen and I set off toward the
mountain top, nearly one thousand feet above us, but
we did not reach it, for the heat was intense.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of us now?” she asked,
on our way down, after I had told her how I had
spent the forenoon.</p>

<p>“I think enough of you to devote my whole life
to your service,” I quickly replied.</p>

<p>She gave me a long, searching look, that seemed to
go right through me and lay my whole soul open
before her, then took the lead and, without a word,
walked rapidly on to her bungalow, and I walked on
to mine.</p>

<p>When I came back to dinner she was waiting for
me in her bower. As she came to meet me and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
extended her hand she said, earnestly and almost
sadly, “I believe you were honest and sincere in what
you said this afternoon, but I can only say ‘Thank
you.’ What you suggested is impossible.”</p>

<p>In the three weeks that followed I urged my love
upon her with all of my determination but she refused
to change her decision and apparently was as firm in
it as at first. It was agreed that we should both
give up piracy, in any form, but all of our arguments
ended there until finally, one afternoon as we
sat looking out over the sea and talking, for once,
of the ordinary affairs of life, she said, slowly and
emphatically, “Deverell was my father’s right-hand-man.
I am going to give this place to him, just as it
stands, take the next ship for England, lay my case
before the Home Secretary and ask him for a full pardon.
I will confess to him that I have taken from
the pirates what they had stolen from others. To
offset the offence I have hundreds of written statements
from people whose lives I have saved from the
pirates by coming up in the nick of time, for which
service I never accepted payment of any kind. I
believe I can secure a pardon and if I do, I will meet
you, with a clear conscience, and become your wife.”</p>

<p>In a tumult of joy, which came over me with the
force of an electric shock, I sprang to her side and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
started to take her in my arms, but she stretched out
her hand and held me off. I had never seen such a
serious look on her exquisite face and there were tears
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” she said, tenderly but firmly. “I have
said I would marry you only when my name had
been cleared of its dishonor, and until that condition
has been complied with you cannot regard me as
your promised wife. After that you may do with me
as you please, but not until then.”</p>

<p>Her accession of conscience had been so great that
she considered herself disgraced, and that nothing
short of a pardon from the British Government, so
bitterly hated by her father, could restore her respectability.
With my most persuasive arguments I tried
to dissuade her from going to England, but without
effect. I urged her to marry me at once and go with
me to America or some other country, where we
would not be reminded of the past and have nothing
to fear from it, but she would not listen. She feared
she would be found and arrested later on and bring
dishonor on me; she seemed to have no thought of
herself in that respect, and, seeing that, I better
understood the depth of her great love.</p>

<p>No argument of mine could change her and there
was nothing to do but fall in with her plan. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
packed up the most treasured of her personal effects,
paid a last visit to the graves of her father and
mother, and two days later we sailed away. Just
before going on board she summoned the villagers
to the empty warehouse and told them she had given
all of her property to Deverell and was going away,
never to return. They wept and showed great distress,
but Kate was quietly happy and her glorious
eyes were firm and undimmed as they looked for the
last time on her beauteous isle.</p>

<p>I knew about where to find the “Florence.” We
picked her up in a few days and I boarded her
and made sail to meet the “Leckwith” at the
rendezvous. Kate went on to Singapore, where she
took the next ship for England. Six months later I
received word that she had died suddenly there, before
she had applied for a pardon, and the course of
my life was changed again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>A DEATH DUEL WITH A PIRATE KING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN I rejoined the “Leckwith,” after having
started the Beautiful White Devil, who
was a devil no longer but the one woman in the
world for me, on her way to England to secure a
pardon for her piracies which would open the way
to our marriage, Frank Norton was very inquisitive
as to where I had been and the reason for my sudden
disappearance from Hong Kong. He had of course
heard from Ah Fen of the woman pirate, who was
mistakenly blamed by the real pirates for some of
our raids on them, while we were held responsible for
some of hers, and I could see that his keen mind had
conceived the suspicion that it was her ship whose
commander I had attended, in my capacity as a surgeon,
after our joint fight with the Malays on the
deck of the British bark, and that she was at the bottom
of my absence, but I declined to discuss the matter
at all or give him any information on the subject.
I told him simply that I had been away on strictly
private business. With even my most intimate
friends I am naturally secretive regarding my purely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
personal affairs, and the “Beautiful White Angel,” as
I now knew her to be, had become so sacred in my
enraptured vision that I did not wish to talk about
her with any one, and least of all with the cynical
Norton. I knew he would base his estimate of her
on her altogether undeserved reputation among
people who had never seen her, and that he would
say something which would make me want to kill
him. There really was no need for that sort of a
finale to our semi-partnership, so I remained silent.
Norton was annoyed by my refusal to take him into
my confidence and went away in a huff, but he was
astounded, a day or two later, when I told him I had
decided to sell the “Florence” and “Surprise,” divide
up the profits with him, and quit the business we
were in.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” he asked in amazement.
“Have you lost your mind?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” I replied, “I have only just
come into my right mind.”</p>

<p>“But look at the money we are making,” he protested.
“Is there any other place where you can
make as much money so easily?”</p>

<p>“There is nobody who gets more satisfaction out
of money than I do,” I said, “but after all it isn’t the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
only thing in the world. I came out here for the
adventure more than for the money.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t the supply of adventure equal to the
demand?” he asked with a tinge of sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Not of the kind that appeals to me. There is
plenty of excitement, of a kind, but not an awful lot
of adventure, as I understand the term. Most of the
time it is nothing more than wholesale butchery of
ignorant Malays and Chinkies who have no chance
against us even though they do outnumber us. And
to make it worse, we steal from them. That is not the
kind of adventure that I enjoy.”</p>

<p>This sort of talk from me must have sounded very
strange and I was not surprised at Norton’s dumbfounded
expression.</p>

<p>“But we only take from them what they have
stolen from somebody else,” he argued. “They have
no right to it, while we can reasonably claim it as
a reward for avenging those whom they have killed
and robbed. Besides that, we ought to get a medal
from the British Government for every one of those
devils we put out of the way, for we are doing the
world a service.”</p>

<p>“That is no argument,” I contended, remembering
Miss Crofton’s curt reproval of my own defence to
her, along just the same line, only a month before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
“The fact that they steal from others gives us no
shadow of right to steal from them. Perhaps it is
a good thing to kill them, but I hold no commission
and draw no salary for that sort of thing. If the
world wants them put out of the way, let the world
attend to it. The world has never done anything for
me that should make me want to assume the whole
contract. If it is a public service to slay pirates, I
have certainly killed my share, and directed the
slaughter of enough more of them to absolve all of
my most distant relatives from any further responsibility
in the matter. Somebody else can now step
up and kill his share, and they can keep it going as
long as they like. I am sick of murdering and robbing,
even though they are pirates, and there will
be no more of it from my ships.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about this ‘Beautiful White
Devil’ Ah Fen has been telling me about?” he shot
at me. He evidently expected to catch me off my
guard, but I was looking for just such an inquiry and
was not at all perturbed.</p>

<p>“There is no such person,” I answered with perfect
truthfulness. “I satisfied myself on that point while
I was in Hong Kong. That is only one of the wild
stories you hear out here where there are so many
people who smoke opium. There may be a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
pirate who sometimes masquerades in female attire,
but there is no woman pirate.”</p>

<p>“It may be,” he suggested sneeringly, “that this
sudden decision of yours to retire is due to the fact
that Moy Sen has threatened to exterminate us. If
you don’t want to fight the old scoundrel, why don’t
you say so, instead of backing out on an assumption
of morality that does not harmonize with your makeup
and with which it is far beyond me to agree.”</p>

<p>That dart struck a tender spot. I would be the
last one to quit under a threat or under fire, and Norton
knew it. The prospect of a rattling final fight
was most alluring. Fighting pirates, I reasoned with
myself, especially when they had declared war on
you, was altogether different from preying on them,
which I had given my word I would not do. It would
be at least six or eight months before my beloved
Kate could secure her pardon and meet me in Bombay,
where we had planned to be married, and that,
I figured, would give me time to accept the “defi” of
the King of the Pirates, if he moved as rapidly as we
might expect.</p>

<p>“Far from running away from a fight of that kind,”
I told Norton, “I should much rather run into it.
We will cruise around a while to see whether the
Chinkies really mean to give us battle. But it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
the sport of it that I want and nothing else, for if it
comes off it will be a great fight. There must be no
more looting.”</p>

<p>Norton apparently considered that he had shaken
my decision to quit preying on the pirates, wherein
he was mistaken, and hoped to be able to induce me
to abandon it entirely. At any rate we were of one
mind in hunting for a scrap with the Chinkies, just
for the fun of it, and harmony was restored.</p>

<p>We loafed around in the path of the pirates below
Great Natuna Island but nothing happened for ten
days or two weeks and it began to look as though
they were not seeking us very earnestly. We saw
several junks which we could easily have stood up
and robbed, but I would not permit it. Late one
evening, just as the galloping night was closing in,
an enormous junk appeared suddenly from behind
an island and came sailing down a narrow strait
through which we were just crawling. Instead of
hurrying along through the dangerous passage, as
she would have done had she been an honest trader,
she began to shorten sail after she had passed us.
That aroused our suspicions and we determined to
look her over. She appeared to carry only a small
crew, but when we came together it seemed to me
for a moment that she had more Chinamen on board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
than I had ever seen before at one time. We
increased our speed a little and drew up alongside
to get a good look at her. We were almost on an
even keel with her when she swung suddenly to starboard
and would have smashed into our bow if we
had not gone full speed astern without losing a
second. As she passed under our short bowsprit she
threw a grappling iron which caught on our port
bow, and we let it stay there.</p>

<p>We lit our battle lamps and hung them along under
the rail so that they illuminated our deck, where we
preferred to fight, because we knew every foot of it.
We had about one hundred and twenty-five men on
the “Leckwith,” Norton having taken the pick of the
crews of the “Florence” and “Surprise,” while I was
away, in order to be prepared for any contingency,
and I had no fear that the pirates could come aboard
fast enough to get away with us. The junk’s grappling
iron held and as soon as she was clear of us
we went ahead slowly. This drew the two ships
together, which was what we wanted. As the junk
swung around we let go our carronades, but we were
at such close quarters that the slugs did not have
time to scatter and simply ploughed small holes
through the mass of men that swarmed her decks.
We gave them a volley of rifle fire and met them with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
another as the ships came together. They rushed
over the rail at us in a sulphur cloud. Then it was
revolvers and cutlasses. The pirates resorted to their
old trick of throwing themselves on the deck, as
though killed or wounded, and trying to hamstring
or disembowel us, but we were up to that game and
were watching for it. We made sure that every
Chinaman was dead when he struck the deck. Every
blow was that of an executioner. In a few minutes,
as it seemed then, though it may have been much
longer, the decks were slippery with blood and I
could actually hear it dripping through the scuppers
into the quiet sea.</p>

<p>It was such a fight as one gets into only in years,
perhaps only once in a lifetime. The butchery was
dreadful but the excitement of it set one’s blood
ablaze. Our men became demons. As they shot and
slashed they shouted and sang. A disarmed Chinkie
seized me around the waist and dragged me in among
his blood-stained fellows, but we were so closely
wedged together that they could not chop at me
without striking each other and they never thought
of stabbing me. Norton and the mighty Lorensen,
swinging an enormous Chinese sword which he had
taken from one of his victims, came to my assistance
and in a twinkling I was free, with dead and maimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
pirates piled up around me in a circle. I could feel
sword cuts now and then but they seemed like pin
pricks. All of us were so covered with blood that
there was no telling whether it came from our own
wounds or those we had inflicted.</p>

<p>“That makes us even,” I shouted to Lorensen, as
I cut down a yellow devil who had crept up behind
him, while he was busy with those in front, and had
his knife raised to put him out of commission. A
Chinkie who had lost his sword seized my empty
pistol from its holster, pressed it over my heart and
pulled the trigger. I let him go that far and then
laughed at him as I backed away and cut his head
half off. I saw Norton go down and fought my way
to him, to find that he had only slipped in a red pool.
He had been singing a loud requiem of profane abuse
over those who met his sword and he resumed it
where he had left off, hardly missing a note. We
kept the pirates in front of us and steadily forced
our way forward. Every time one of our own men
fell it made us fight the harder. The Chinkies cut and
slashed with all of their desperate savagery but it
was impossible for them to stand before the fury of
our men and, though they outnumbered us four or
five to one, they finally began to give way. We followed
them onto their own deck and piled them up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
on top of each other. Finally a lot of them took to
the hold and the rest, perhaps a hundred of them,
jumped overboard. Those that foolishly fled to the
hold we treated to a dose of their own medicine.
We threw their stink-pots down among them until
the air was thick with the poisonous smoke, and
closed the hatches. Some of them, gasping and
blinded, tried to escape through the guarded gangways;
the rest of them died in the hold. There was
not a pirate left alive on the junk or on our own deck.</p>

<p>We looked upon our work and pronounced it good,
but before we had time to congratulate ourselves or
count noses to ascertain the extent to which we had
suffered, we discovered a big steamer almost on top
of us. It was the “Ly-ce-moon,” the flagship of Moy
Sen’s fleet, and, though we did not know it, the old
pirate chief himself was in command of her. We
barely had time to refill our revolvers and get back
onto the “Leckwith,” when she banged into us and
made fast with her grapplers. She was nearly twice
the size of the “Leckwith” and her rail was three or
four feet above ours. We did not know how many
men she carried nor did any of us care, for we were
mad with monotonous murder; the bestial blood lust
that comes from a glut of human butchery was over
all of us. We were both exhilarated and enraged;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
stimulated by the quick work we had made of the
junk, and furious at the revelation of the cunning
trap that had been set for us. The junk was the bait.
It was expected that we would attack and board her;
that our boarding force would be overwhelmed by
the hundreds of devils who were crammed into her
hold, and while this fight was on the “Ly-ce-moon”
was to come up on the other side and finish us off.
It was shrewdly planned and if we had not been on
our guard and suspicious of everything, we would have
fallen into the trap, and delayed matters so long
that when it came we would have had a fight on our
hands which it would have been hard to win. As I
reasoned it out, when we ranged alongside of the
junk to size her up more closely, as soon as she came
up with us, her commander, naturally thinking we
were preparing to attack him, decided that the cunning
thing for him to do was to throw his horde
aboard of us instead of waiting for us to board him.
He supposed we carried only our ordinary crew, as
all of our extra men were out of sight, and figured
that it would be an easy game for him, in which he
stood to win a lot of glory with no chance of losing;
for even if we should develop unexpected strength,
the steamer would come up in time to make our
defeat certain. Nothing but this turn of affairs, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
was not according to the programme, and the fury
with which our augmented crew went at the Chinkies,
made it possible for us to render the junk entirely
harmless before Moy Sen arrived.</p>

<p>When he threw his grappling irons we made them
fast and, before he had time to think, or to see all that
had happened, we were scrambling over his high
sides, each man armed with a revolver in one hand
and a cutlass in the other. The Chinaman, even
when he is a pirate, has no rapid resourcefulness.
When you “switch the cut” on him, or do anything
in a different way from that in which he expects
you to do it, he has to stop and figure it out
and fix himself all over again. Moy Sen’s crew
were prepared to board us, and when we made the
offensive our defensive, and carried the fight to them
with an altogether unexpected rush, they were
so taken by surprise that they offered little real
resistance to our invasion. But by the time we
were all on board they had regained their senses and
the fight that followed was even more savage than
the one before it. There were no lights, except those
under the “Leckwith’s” rail, which did us little good,
and the pirates fired at us from hiding places about
their well-known decks, which we could not make out
until our eyes had become accustomed to the darkness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Our men shot and, when their revolvers were
empty, slashed at every noise. In order that we
might not attack each other we kept up a contemptuous
chant of curses on the Chinese, counting
time to it with our cutlasses.</p>

<p>The result was a repetition of what had occurred
with the crew of the junk, but it required much
longer to accomplish it. The junk had carried more
men than the steamer, for it was planned that those on
the junk were to do the brunt of the fighting and get
us going before the others came at us from behind;
but the first battle was fought on a well-lighted deck
with every foot of which we were familiar, while
the second struggle took place on a strange ship and
in semi-darkness, which was lightened only by the
lamps on our own ship below us and a few stars
above, for the sky was overcast with clouds.</p>

<p>We strung our forces along the full length of the
“Ly-ce-moon,” to prevent the pirates from getting
behind us, and fought our way crosswise of the ship.
One of the first things that caught my eye was the
figure of a gigantic Chinaman in the afterpart of
the vessel, who at first directed the fight and then
took a large hand in it himself. It was, as I suspected
at the time from the manner in which he had
been described to me by Ah Fen, old Moy Sen himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
who had paid us the high honor of taking personal
charge of the campaign against us. He was
the biggest Chinaman I had ever seen and must have
been a full-blooded Tartar. He was raw-boned and
his face, of which I now and then caught a glimpse,
was that of a fiend. He had tremendously long
arms and every time he swung his sword he cleared
a space. Lorensen and I, who were close together
while Norton was farther forward, tried to fight our
way to him, but we were held back by important
business directly in front of us that demanded immediate
attention. By the time we succeeded in working
our way aft, the chief of all the pirates had
disappeared.</p>

<p>Made more desperate by the annihilation of their
comrades on the junk and inspired by the presence
of their great leader, and his commanding and
defiant shouts, the Chinkies fought with a grim stubbornness
which I had never before seen them display.
They made no noise about it but kept chopping
away, sometimes aimlessly, but always chopping.
The scent of veritable rivers of blood would have
sickened us, and our tired arms, like those of our
enemies, would have settled into a methodical swing,
had we not been spurred on by one victory and the
prospect of a still greater one. My sword was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
broken off at the hilt in warding off a vicious blow,
but before another one could be struck I seized a
fortunately falling Chinkie and held him in front of
me, while his blood gushed all over me, until I had
secured his sword, which I used as effectively as my
own. In trying to hamstring me a half-dead pirate
gashed the calf of my leg to the bone, yet I scarcely
noticed it. I felt something trickling down my face
and knew a glancing blow had laid open my scalp,
but there was no twinge of pain. It was the same
with all of the others. No one thought of his wounds
unless he was disabled, when, if he had strength
enough, he dragged himself to the rear to be out of
the way. Nothing was in our minds but to fight
and win. Had there been twice as many of the
pirates the result, in the end, would have been the
same, for it was not in us to be defeated that night.
Gradually, but slowly at first, we got the upper hand
of them. When the inspiring voice of their chief was
silenced they gave way more rapidly and our men
chased them over the side and rushed into cabins,
deckhouses, for’c’sle, engine room, and stokehole, hunting
out those who had sought hiding places, and
putting an end to the continued danger of pot shots.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight by the time we had thrown
overboard the last of the dead Chinamen and washed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
down the decks, after giving our own badly wounded
men such attention as was possible under the conditions.
We thought for a time that Moy Sen had
escaped, but we found him, almost chopped to pieces,
close to the after wheelhouse, with three of our men
dead beside him. Except for his great size we would
not have known him, but he was identified by Ah
Fen, who was the only one on board who had ever
seen him. We had twenty-one men killed and twice
as many so seriously injured that a number of them
subsequently died, and there was hardly a man of
us who did not have one or more wounds of some
kind. In addition to the cut on my leg, which was a
nasty one and barely missed the tendons, and the
scalp wound, which was not a severe one, I had a
dozen cuts and gashes of assorted sizes and widely
distributed. The point of a sword had ripped open
my already scarred cheek and another one had taken
away a souvenir from my arm. Norton had a long
cut along his abdomen, which almost accomplished
the intended disembowelment, and half of one ear
was hanging by the skin. He also had many minor
injuries, but neither of us was damaged beyond
speedy repair. Lorensen, a mighty man in any position,
who had sent as many Chinamen to join Confucius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
as had any of us, was one of the very few who
escaped with only trifling scratches.</p>

<p>On the “Ly-ce-moon” were two teak chests, filled
with gold and silver coin and ingots, silverware,
jewelry, and precious and semi-precious stones, of the
Oriental variety, apparently representing the most
valuable portions of several stolen cargoes, and these
I allowed to be transferred to the “Leckwith,” in
preference to throwing them overboard. It then
became a question as to what we should do with Moy
Sen’s ships. There was some apprehension that if
we took them with us we might run into a cruiser
and be unable satisfactorily to explain exactly how
we came into possession of them and what we were
doing with such a large crew on a private yacht.
We compromised the difficulty by scuttling the junk
and putting a crew aboard the steamer. We went to
Singapore, arriving there in the early Summer of 1876,
as I remember it, to close up our business, and sold
the pirate ship to our Chinese agents for a third of
what she was worth. We also sold to them, for a
small part of its value, the loot we had taken from
her, but all of that money was divided up between
Norton and the crew. I held to my promise and
touched none of it. We retained about twenty-five
of our best men, paid the others off, after dividing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
up a large share of our profits with all of them, placed
the injured in a hospital, and headed for Hong
Kong, where the “Florence” and “Surprise” had
been ordered to report. On the way we stopped at
a small, out-of-the-way island, landed all of our guns
and most of our small arms, and, after covering them
well with red lead and tallow, buried them in a deep
hole, over which we planted a lot of young cocoanut
trees. The “Leckwith” then became, in fact, a
private yacht. We had no anxiety regarding our old
friends, the pirates, for there was nothing we could
not run away from.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that we removed all traces of
piracy and restored the “Leckwith” to an honest
vessel for as soon as we reached Hong Kong we
were boarded and inspected with great care. It
transpired that while I was away with Miss Crofton,
Norton had landed at a little village a hundred
and fifty miles down the coast and played hob with
it. I knew nothing about it until after we were
examined, when Lorensen told me about it. Norton’s
excuse was that he believed the village was
inhabited only by pirates and he wanted to teach
them a lesson, but there was no doubt in my mind
that he had hoped to find a lot of loot there. The
“Leckwith,” naturally, answered the descriptions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
the ship that made the raid, and if we had not been
nicely cleaned up when the officers came aboard, we
undoubtedly would have been arrested for piracy,
instead of which we were absolved from all suspicion.</p>

<p>The “Florence” was waiting for us and I at once
disposed of her, through our agents, to an English
trading company. In a few weeks the “Surprise”
came in from Yokohama, where she had delivered a
cargo, and was sold to a Japanese house with a
branch in Hong Kong. I remember that she brought
seven thousand pounds, which I gave to Norton.
We paid off their crews, with a bonus and their share
of the profits, and saw that they were scattered and
shipped on long voyages in different directions, as
we had done with the surplus crew of the “Leckwith.”
We had no fear that they would carelessly
tell what they knew about our operations, for they
were pleased with their treatment and, beyond that,
self-protection would have stood in the way of any
complaint against us, but we considered it wise to
distribute them to the four corners of the earth
before they had an opportunity to fill up with rum
and become braggarts, wherein would be danger to
all of us. The two captains, Brown and Heather,
had fallen under the spell of the China Sea, with its
dangers and its delights, and were in no hurry to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
leave it for prosaic England, but we knew they could
be relied on; if they had not been discreet and close-mouthed
I never would have engaged them. I had
been out East about two years and considered that
the adventures I had encountered there amply repaid
me for the time, to say nothing of the joy I had found
in establishing the identity of the Beautiful White
Devil as a real, live being, and falling in love with
her. Therefore I insisted on treating all of our men
with a liberality that amounted to prodigality, but
even after that Norton and I divided up something
over three hundred thousand dollars, as the remaining
share of what we had cleaned up from the
pirates.</p>

<p>We loafed around Hong Kong for weeks, for it
had been arranged that Miss Crofton should communicate
with me there as to the probable result of
her effort to secure a pardon after the confession she
intended to make to the Home Secretary. Finally
the word came, and it was a great shock to me, for
it was a report of her death, which occurred suddenly
at her old home in Ireland, soon after she arrived
there on her way to London. I had been in
love before, more times than once, but never so
much as with her. For her I was ready to give
up my adventurous life, but the knowledge that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
was gone from me made me more desperate than
ever. I was tempted to resume the old piratical life,
yet I could not bear to remain amid scenes that
would constantly remind me of her. So I left the
China Sea behind me and never have returned to it.</p>

<p>On receipt of the heart-breaking news I told Norton
the whole story of how I became acquainted with
the beautiful Miss Crofton and fell in love with her,
and how my romance had been shattered. I told
him he could stay there if he wanted to, and return
to the old life if he wished, but that I intended to
leave at once and for all time. He declared he would
go with me, and suggested that we take a trip to
Australia; but I was moody and wanted to cruise
around a bit, in the solitude of the open sea, with no
definite object in view. We headed up along the
coast and Norton, who was looking after the navigation
of the ship, in which I had lost all interest for
the time being, put in at Amoy, for want of something
better to do. He thought a visit to a strange
port might do me good. While we were lying there
Norton became acquainted with a Chinese or Corean
merchant. He was anxious to get up to the Shantung
Peninsula, where the Germans were beginning
to establish themselves firmly with the idea of taking
possession of that rich section of China when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
the Empire was divided up among the “friendly”
powers, so called because they were altogether
unfriendly, and Norton proposed that we continue
our indefinite journey that far and take him along.
I agreed, thinking we might find something interesting
in new scenes. When we got nearly up to the
Peninsula Norton unfolded a new scheme. Our merchant
passenger, he said, had told him of a lot of
treasure buried in a cemetery in Corea, close to a
river and not a great way from the coast, which was
guarded only by the superstitious native fear of the
dead. It would be an easy matter to secure the
treasure, according to his story, and he offered to
lead us to it if we would give him a share of it. By
that time I was in a frame of mind to welcome any
excitement and I told Norton to close with him and
go ahead.</p>

<p>Accordingly we altered our course and sailed for
the west coast of Corea. I do not know how far we
followed it but we stopped at the mouth of a small
river, which ran close to the cemetery, about twelve
miles up. We went up to it at night in a steam
launch we had bought at Hong Kong; Norton, the
merchant, and I, and eight men. The cemetery, which
was five hundred yards back from the river, was an
open space of perhaps ten acres, filled with funny-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> 
graves, covered with signs and charms. In
the centre of it was an unroofed structure about fifty
feet square, with stone walls twelve or fifteen feet
high. It was there, said our guide, that the money
was concealed.</p>

<p>Just as we came to the edge of the burying ground
a procession of twenty or twenty-five white-robed
men, marching in Indian file and carrying a number
of ladders, appeared on the opposite side. They
marched to the square structure, raised their ladders
against the wall and went over. In half an hour they
climbed out again, with several large and heavy sacks
which were lowered with some difficulty, took down
their ladders and marched away in silence. Our
guide explained, with many Chinese curses, that they
doubtless were a delegation sent from Seoul after
the treasure. Certainly they had taken something
away with them and it probably was money. There
was no telling whether it was gold, silver, or copper,
for all our guide professed to know was that a “large
amount” was hidden there. From the size and
weight of the numerous sacks in which it was carried
away I got the idea that the “treasure” consisted of
the cheap “cash” used in that country and China
and that the total value of it probably did not exceed
a few hundred dollars at the most. Had it been made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
up of gold coin it would have represented the
national wealth of Corea.</p>

<p>Some of the store might have been left behind, but
I did not care to investigate. The outlook was not
promising and the situation was uncanny to a degree
that got on my already depressed nervous system; so,
with some random remarks about Corean methods of
burying their dead and hiding their money, we
walked back to the launch and returned to the ship,
without having derived even a reasonable amount of
excitement from the trip. That fiasco finally fixed
in me a resolution, that had been forming for some
time, to get entirely away from that part of the
world. We turned about and landed our disappointed
passenger at Shanghai and from there took
a course almost due south, which carried us east of
the Philippine Islands, down through Molucca Pass,
past the Island of Celebes, into the Florida Sea, and
out through the Floris Strait into the Indian Ocean.
Our final objective port was London, but I had no
wish to make another trip through the China Sea
and its islands at the south, which held so many
painful memories, and took this roundabout course
to avoid them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE BURIAL OF THE “LECKWITH”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON my way back to England on the “Leckwith,”
along toward the end of the still sadly remembered
year of 1876, after having said farewell to the
China Sea, with its beauty, booty, and blood, we
decided to go around by the Cape of Good Hope to
look South Africa over a bit. By that time I was
eager for anything that offered excitement and diversion,
without regard to either the principles which
were involved or the lack of them. I had brooded
over the death of the Beautiful White Devil, for
love of whom I was willing to give up my old ways
and become a quiet and orderly person, until I had
interpreted it to mean that the unseen and unknown
directing force of my career had no sympathy with
my reformatory resolutions and had taken that brutal
way of making plain the command that I was to
remain a homeless adventurer. The result was that
my nature, for the time being, was as embittered as
it had been exalted only a short time before, and my
hand was raised against every one. Norton, my partner
in this expedition, was delighted with the change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
that had come over me, and hailed with unconcealed
joy what he regarded as my return to a normal frame
of mind.</p>

<p>We put in at the Mauritius for coal and there we
heard stories regarding the still flourishing slave
trade which led us to believe we might find some
spirited and profitable sport with them, in the same
way that we had preyed on the Chinese and Malay
pirates out East. We sailed around Cape St. Mary
into the Mozambique Canal, between the East African
coast and the island of Madagascar, and began
bartering for ivory, gold dust, palm nuts, and animal
skins, as a mask for our real purpose and to give us
a favorable opportunity to study the situation. Investigation
proved that we had been correctly advised
regarding it. The Sultan of Zanzibar had practically
suppressed the sale of slaves in his domain, but the
only effect had been to drive the trade down the coast,
and large numbers of negroes from the interior were
being handled by the Arabs, who were born to the
business. For the pick of the slaves there was a
regular course down the White Nile and the Blue
Nile and on across into Arabia, hitting the back trail
on the path of Moses. The rest of the unfortunate
victims of a civilization which makes might right
were driven in long strings down to the coast, chiefly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
to Mozambique and to the delta of the Zambesi River,
which was a favorite spot for barterings in blacks.
The bulk of these slaves were intended for shipment
across the channel to Madagascar, where there
always was a demand for them among the old Hovas,
or aristocrats, who owned the large plantations. The
balance of them were sent to the Arabian coast for
distribution. They were shipped to both markets in
<i>dhows</i>, low-lying vessels that, with a fair wind and
comparatively smooth sea, could make almost steamship
time. They need to be fast, for a British
cruiser, on the lookout for just such ships, was continually
patrolling the channel in the general course
of a figure 8, and sometimes there were two or three
of them on the watch. The Arabs kept close tab
on the warships and knew about where they were at
all times, except when they doubled on their course,
which they sometimes did, with occasional disastrous
results.</p>

<p>When the chocolate caravans reached the mouths
of the Zambesi sales were held, both public and private,
at which the slave-dealers bought from the slave-catchers
as many negroes as they thought they
could handle. The blacks were placed in pens or
stockades and kept there until the coast was clear
and a dhow ready to sail, when, chained together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
by the neck in batches of six, they were driven on
board and stowed away under the hatches, from
two hundred to four hundred constituting a shipload.
The average price of these slaves in Madagascar
was one hundred dollars, but when, on account
of the watchfulness of the warships, they had been
kept long in the pens and were fat and strong, they
brought considerably more,—sometimes twice as
much.</p>

<p>In the guise of a peaceful trader, with nothing
about us to arouse suspicion, we loafed along the
slave coast until we had a good line on the manner
in which the Arabs conducted their operations and
knew the general routine of the movements of the
watching warships. With a satisfactory understanding
of the general situation we signed on, at Mozambique,
seventy-five additional men, who were ready
for any service, equipped ourselves with such paraphernalia
as we required, and launched out into the
business of snatching slaves. Our ordinary method
was to cruise along the Madagascar coast until we
sighted a dhow sailing along in a light breeze, or,
better still, becalmed. We would just keep her in
sight until nightfall. If she was becalmed we would
close in on her, with our lights doused, until we were
two or three miles away; if she was under slow way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
we would get the same distance in advance of her.
Then we would lower five or six boats, each carrying
ten or twelve well-armed men, and attack her from
as many different directions. Norton or I always
went along in command of the expedition. We tried
to surprise the Arabs, and on some very dark nights
we succeeded, but most frequently they surprised us
by being prepared for our visit. There was always a
fight and sometimes, with the larger dhows, a full-fledged
battle. We could not use large guns without
danger of killing the cargo, so it was altogether
revolver and cutlass work on our side. The Arabs
used long rifles with beautifully inlaid handles, which
really were deadly weapons in spite of their fanciful
appearance, and curved swords, in the use of
which they were artists. They fought hard enough,
viciously, in fact, but we generally had as many men
as they carried, or more, and when we did not catch
them napping we confused them by attacking them
simultaneously at five or six points. We had a man
killed now and then and had a number put out of
commission with more or less serious wounds, but
we suffered little in comparison with the damages
we inflicted.</p>

<p>With the fight over we would transfer the Arabs
to the “Leckwith,” where we put them in irons or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
somewhere else, and place a crew on the dhow to
navigate her to the coast and sell the slaves. Our
attacks were always made close inshore to minimize
the danger of being ourselves surprised and overhauled
by a warship. We would follow the captured
dhow in with the “Leckwith” and stand off and
on two or three miles offshore, watching for interference
and waiting for the transaction to be closed,
when we would send boats in and pick up our crew,
which invariably was in charge of Norton or I or
Lorensen. The dhow was sold or presented to the
purchaser of the slaves.</p>

<p>The activity was continuous, for we were always
scurrying around in search of slaves, yet the excitement
of it was not so thrilling as I had anticipated.
We had been following this new, and I must admit
somewhat revolting occupation only a few weeks
when the crew of a small dhow set their ship on
fire as we were closing in on it one night and took to
the boats before a shot had been fired. By the time
we got on board the whole afterpart of the vessel was
in flames and we had all we could do to keep it from
spreading forward far enough to reach the slaves,
who were in a panic and were making the night
melodious with the wildest yells I had ever heard.
As soon as the blaze was made out from the “Leckwith,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
Norton brought her alongside and we succeeded
in transferring all of the negroes to her, but
with great difficulty, for they were almost helpless
from fear and, chained together as they were, it was
hard to handle them quickly. However, it was a
small shipment, and all of our men who could be
spared from fighting the fire eventually got them
below decks on the “Leckwith,” after which we let
the dhow burn, and made fast time away from her
for fear the flames would attract some passing ship.
It was several days before we got rid of the slaves,
for the first port we visited was overstocked, and in
that time they filled the ship with an indescribable
stench that it was impossible to eradicate, and in the
end it proved her undoing.</p>

<p>One evening not long after that, just at dusk, as
we came around Cape St. Andrew, we ran right into
a British gunboat—I think it was the old “Penelope.”
She at once changed her course, came alongside
and hailed us:</p>

<p>“What ship is that?”</p>

<p>“The ‘Jane Meredith,’ from Delagoa Bay to Suez,”
I shouted back, and I had the papers to prove it.</p>

<p>We were ordered to heave to and a lieutenant
came aboard us. His manner, as he came over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
rail, indicated that he was suspicious of us. He first
examined our papers and passed them.</p>

<p>“You’re damned light to be going north,” he said,
as he looked over the manifest, which showed only
the small cargo of skins and palm nuts that we
always carried.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” I admitted, “but we’ve been out East
for three years and I’m anxious to get back to England.
I came around this way thinking we might
pick up a cargo, but there’s not much doing.”</p>

<p>“It looks as though there had been something
doing,” he exclaimed a few minutes later, when he
saw the number of men we had on board. “What
in thunder are you doing with so many men?”</p>

<p>“We had three ships out East,” I explained. “I
sold the others to the Japs. The crews did not want
to stay with them. When they signed I agreed to
return them to England, and I am taking them back
myself, rather than pay their passage; that’s all.”</p>

<p>He looked skeptical, but asked no further questions
along that line, except to inquire the names of the
ships I had sold and their rig.</p>

<p>The moment he poked his nose in the hold and
sniffed the air he turned on me and declared, with an
air of finality, “You’ve been running slaves.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like it,” I replied, just as positively.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
“There were a lot of niggers at the Mauritius who
wanted to get to Delagoa Bay and as we were going
there I took them along, at two shillings a head.
They grubbed themselves and most of them lived
down here, as we were crowded above. If I had
known they would stink the ship up so I wouldn’t
have carried them at any price.”</p>

<p>“That’s the regular slave smell,” he insisted,
apparently by no means convinced by my calm statement.
“Your craft isn’t fitted up as though you had
to transport niggers to keep you in coal.”</p>

<p>“I don’t make a business of it,” I told him, “but
I’ve got to carry something besides two extra crews,
or lose money.”</p>

<p>Without continuing the argument, his silence adding
to my apprehension, he went on over the ship
and examined every foot of it. He found nothing
to strengthen the suspicions I was convinced he had
formed, but he had already seen, and smelled, enough
to make me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The moment the young officer’s launch was clear
of us we got under way at full speed. He had to
row only a couple of hundred yards to the gunboat
and we had not gone a mile before a shot was fired
after us as a signal to heave to again. Evidently
the commander of the warship, as soon as he heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
the lieutenant’s report, had decided to hold us on
suspicion, but we had no idea of being held. It was
dark by that time and, as we showed no lights, the
gunboat could not pursue us, nor could she tell
which way to shoot. We saw her lights trailing us
for a while, but she soon gave up the chase.</p>

<p>I knew it would not do for us to run afoul of that
gunboat, after that, or any other, for the word would
be passed quickly along, and they would be on the
lookout to pick us up. We became much more careful
than we had been before, but in spite of our precautions,
or perhaps because of them, things began
to go against us. Not long afterward, while we were
waiting on the outer edge of a bay a short distance
south of Kitombo to pick up Norton and a party who
had landed a cargo of slaves from a captured dhow,
we had to run for it from a cruiser that happened
along. Though she never got within range she gave
us a long chase and it was a week before we considered
it safe to go back after Norton and his men.
The Arabs were increasing their crews and we had a
succession of hard fights with them, in which we lost
a number of men. Norton was half knocked out and,
in addition to several minor injuries which I had
accumulated, I had a bullet hole through the fleshy
part of the arm that was giving me considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
trouble. And with it all we were constantly offended
by the stench which those slaves had left in the hold,
as though to haunt us.</p>

<p>I never have believed in overplaying my luck,
and it required only a few setbacks to convince me
that fortune had turned against us, so I decided to
make another change. Preying on slavers was nasty
business, anyway, though rich in profits, and I had had
enough of it. I had become superstitious, too, about
the sickening, odoriferous heritage which the slaves
had left with us. We were likely to be recognized
wherever we went, and that smell would convict us.
Running slaves ranked with piracy and conviction
meant a two-step on air at the end of a yardarm,
which was not a pleasing prospect. Therefore I
determined to quit the business and bury all traces
of it, including the “Leckwith.” She had paid for
herself many times over and I could afford to lose
her. Besides, if I kept her she would continually
remind me of my experiences in the China Sea, and
those I was equally anxious to forget.</p>

<p>I paid off all of the extra men, giving them double
wages and a share of the profits, and told them of
my plans, so far as they were concerned. We had
plenty of coal to take us as far as I intended to go
and I did not care to put into any port for fear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
being recognized. Therefore I told them we would
take them to within twelve or fifteen miles of Zanzibar,
where they would take to the boats and sail
ashore. They could land quietly, and probably
unnoticed, but if any questions were asked them they
were to report that the ship had foundered. This
plan was carried out and they were started landward
with provisions and water.</p>

<p>We continued on our solemn journey until we came
to a point about twenty miles off Aden, near the
lower end of the Red Sea, and there we proceeded
to bury the “Leckwith” and her ghost, the smell of
the slaves. The funeral was conducted, early in the
morning, with becoming ceremony and with sincere
sorrow on the part of all of us. It is a terrifying thing
to have a ship go down under you, even in a smooth
sea and with the shore in sight, but it is a human
tragedy to deliberately sink your own ship, and a
long and intimate association, filled with dangers,
such as mine had been with the “Leckwith,” manifolds
the melancholy of it. I had thought I could
send her down without great concern, inasmuch as
it was necessary to protect her from capture and
ourselves from arrest, but when the time came to do
it I understood something of the feelings of the Western<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
frontiersmen when they killed their wives to prevent
them from falling into the hands of the Indians.</p>

<p>In the nearly ten years that I had been with her
she had carried me safely through more dangers than
fall to the life of the ordinary man, even though he
be as ardent a lover of the sea and of adventure as I
myself. No storm that blew had ever driven her to
shelter or made her question the security she felt in my
hands. In all sorts of weather, under sail or steam, she
had carried me clear of every pursuing ship that challenged
her speed. However rough the usage she never
rebelled or complained; wherever I directed her she
went as true and straight as an arrow, with never a
misstep or a falter. If she had been disgraced it was
because I had elected to dishonor her; no part of the
blame was hers. She was not an inanimate, unfeeling
thing conceived by man out of iron and steel, but a living,
breathing, human creation, with all the passion
and sympathy and devotion of a woman, and, as is the
way of most mortals, I did not know my own love
for her until I was about to lose her. I am not much
given to weeping, but there were tears in my eyes
as I gave the signal that stilled forever the steady
pulsations of her great, true heart, and I could feel
the death tremor running through her as she came
to a stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>While a royal salute boomed from her yacht’s gun
forward I read over her the burial service at sea prescribed
by the Church of England. Her own flag was
sent to the maintop and the rest of her bunting was
astream from stern to bowsprit, over the mastheads.
Then, with the small boats forming a cortege alongside,
we opened her seacocks, pulled a short distance
away, and watched her slowly sink to her grave, tenderly
lowered by her own mother, the sea. We had
taken our revolvers along for that particular purpose,
our protection being a secondary consideration, and
as the waves that her broken heart had warmed
caressed the topmost flag we fired another salute in
her honor, as the final tribute of a love that, long
smouldering and not understood, had been fanned
into full flame by her burial, and she was gone. I
owned many ships after that but never one among
them was I so sure of, under all conditions, as I was
of her.</p>

<p>The ocean whispered to itself of her brave deeds
as it closed in over her and we hoisted rags of sails
on our three boats and headed for Aden, where we
landed late in the afternoon with a carefully prepared
story of the sinking of an imaginary ship. Aden was
a port of call for ships running out East and we took
the next one that came in for England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>We reached London early in 1877 where I learned
with delight that war between Russia and Turkey was
imminent. The first thing I did was to dissolve my
partnership with Norton. While I had greatly enjoyed
the adventures that were a part of it, I did not relish
the business to which he had introduced me. I do not
seek to avoid any responsibility for my own acts; I
went into the business with my eyes open but it was
not exactly the sort of thing I was cut out for, and it
left a bad taste in my mouth. Moreover, I preferred
to operate alone.</p>

<p>Norton joined his wife, who was living in Devonshire,
and I went to the Langham Hotel, where I put
myself in touch with my old agents and other dealers
in contraband, for I hoped the coming war would
produce some legitimate business. I was not disappointed,
for very soon I was asked to meet the diplomatic
agent of Montenegro, a little principality lying
on the Adriatic between Turkey and Austria-Hungary,
which was at that time subject to the Sublime
Porte. It was cut off from the sea by a narrow military
strip which was occupied by Austria. Cattaro,
the natural seaport of Montenegro, was within this
strip and was guarded by Austrian soldiers. The
Montenegrin border was not more than a mile away,
right at the top of the precipitous mountains that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
surround the little town, but the passage of arms
across it was forbidden, and so strictly was this law
enforced that people crossing from or into Montenegro
were compelled to leave their rifles and
even their revolvers with the guard at the frontier,
until they returned. Everything that passed into Montenegro
was subjected to close inspection by the Austrian
troops, and it seemed to me, as I first studied the
situation, that the delivery of a cargo of contraband
to the little principality would present many unusual
and interesting difficulties.</p>

<p>I met the diplomatic agent, by appointment, at the
old Jerusalem Coffee House, near Corn Hill, and he
showed me a commission from Prince Nicholas himself
to establish his responsibility. He wanted me to
deliver a cargo of arms at Cattaro for Montenegro
and said he was willing to pay liberally but not
extravagantly for the service, as the danger, to one
skilled in the handling of contraband, would be slight.
I inquired what he proposed to do with the arms after
they reached Cattaro, as their importation into his
country was forbidden, but he politely replied that
that was something with which I need not concern
myself, inasmuch as he could positively assure me
that I need have no fear of having my ship seized
at Cattaro or getting into trouble there. He told me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
the Montenegrins proposed to take advantage of the
Russo-Turkish war, which was then certain, though it
was not formally declared until April 27, to make a
determined effort to throw off the Turkish yoke, and
that the arms were urgently needed for that purpose.
He said that if the Porte heard so much as a hint
that they were buying arms I might be stopped by a
Turkish ship; therefore the greatest secrecy must be
maintained and I should be prepared with a full set
of forged papers which would be so convincing that
any Turk who might board my ship would be afraid
to inspect the cargo for fear of offending England.</p>

<p>We came to terms without any difficulty, as I was
anxious to get back into my own business, and, as
I had no ship of my own, I chartered a small steamship
for the voyage. The arms were shipped to
Amsterdam, to conceal their real destination, and I
picked them up there, after they had been repacked
into cases weighing from one hundred and fifty to
two hundred pounds. This was done so that they
could be taken up the mountain-side from Cattaro on
muleback without unpacking. There were about ten
thousand rifles and a great quantity of ammunition.
We encountered no inquisitive Turks and the trip
was made without incident. Cattaro is buried at the
head of the Bocche di Cattaro (mouths of Cattaro),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
a great S-shaped bay, and rare scenic views of impressive
grandeur were opened up to us with every turn
of the tortuous channel, as we wound our way
through it. Bold, bluff mountains ran right down to
the water’s edge and off to the north were the high
peaks of Herzegovina.</p>

<p>According to programme, we got up to Cattaro just
at dusk and after the custom house had closed. As
soon as we had made fast a Montenegrin official, who
had been waiting for us, came aboard, paid me my
charges in gold, and asked me to get the cargo out
as quickly as possible. With the appearance of the
first boxes a long string of pack ponies came trotting
down the dock, and as fast as they were brought up
from the hold the boxes were placed on their waiting
backs and hustled off up the mountain-side. By daylight
the whole cargo was across the frontier, or close
to it. I could not but feel that I was taking some
chance in letting it go so unceremoniously, but I had
been so convincingly assured, both by the diplomatic
agent in London and by the official who took charge
of the unloading, that there would be no trouble for
me, that I decided to run the risk. When the custom
house opened I presented my papers, which called
for a cargo of general merchandise. No questions
were asked as to the disposition of the goods and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
I was given a clearance, or permit to leave the port.
This clinched my suspicion, which had been growing
stronger with each of the preceding incidents, that
the arms were imported with the secret approval of
the Austrian Government. Austria had previously
proved her friendship for Montenegro by refusing
to allow the Turks to occupy Cettinje, the capital,
after they had suppressed the last revolt. The Montenegrins
rose again during the Russo-Turkish war,
which began soon after our arrival at Cattaro, and,
with the aid of the arms I had carried to them, finally
achieved their long-prayed-for independence, which
was acknowledged by Turkey in the Treaty of Berlin.</p>

<p>I devoted a few days to a visit in Cettinje, which,
far from what my imagination had pictured it, was
nothing but a collection of hovels, but the people
were in marked contrast to their surroundings and
made up for the shortcomings of their homes. The
men were tall, very few of them being under six feet,
and handsome; the girls were beautiful, with the
grace and features of nobility, but, as most of the
hard work fell to them while the men protected them,
they aged quickly. In their picturesque native costume,
resplendent with crimson and gold, they were
the handsomest race I had seen in Europe. War
enthusiasm was rampant and nothing else was talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
of. I was tempted to stay and fight with them;
if I had known their language I think I would have
done so, for they are born warriors and the love of
it will never fail them. Their dream, as with all of
their race in the Balkans, is the restoration of the
great Servian Empire of six hundred years ago, which
included practically all of the peninsula, and so long
as they exist they will be trying to drive the Turk
out of Europe.</p>

<p>I loafed along through the Mediterranean on my
way back to London and spent the next year or more
in enjoying myself and squandering money, which, in
those days, was my favorite pastime after a series of
adventures. I knew I had only to go to sea to coin
more money, so the spending of it produced nothing
but pleasure. In the Spring of 1879, with the breaking
out of the boundary war in which always aggressive
Chile was matched against Peru and Bolivia, which
two neighbors had long been in secret alliance to
guarantee the independence of each other, the call to
South America came to me again. I itched to have
a hand in the affair and my desire was soon gratified
when I responded to a summons from the manager
for Sir William Armstrong &amp; Co., the gun makers.
He said he had a shipment of heavy guns for Peru,
which were to be delivered at San Lorenzo, a fort on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
an island, which guards the city, at the entrance to
the Bay of Callao. Callao is the port of Lima, the
capital, and I was advised that the Chilanos were
maintaining an effective blockade there. Peru had
only six serviceable ships when the war started.
Chile had a much stronger fleet though her ships were
of inferior speed. She had so many of them, however,
that Peru had been unable to raise the blockade.
After stating the situation, Armstrong’s manager sent
me to Great Portland Place to interview the Peruvian
naval <i>attaché</i>, who had charge of the shipment.
“It is a ticklish job,” was the manager’s parting advice.
“You will find spies all along the line and it will
require all of your skill to deliver the cargo. Don’t
be mealy-mouthed about the price you ask for it.”</p>

<p>I agreed with the naval <i>attaché</i> to deliver the
guns at Callao for fifty thousand dollars. He was
inclined to haggle over the price, but came to my
terms in the end. It was stipulated that I was to
receive that amount if the cargo was delivered or if
my ship was sunk by the Chilanos while defending
herself, whereas if I was captured or if I sank the
ship to avoid capture, I was to get nothing. I knew
I would need a ship that could do sixteen knots an
hour or better for this undertaking and as I preferred
to own her, so that I could do what I pleased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
with her, I bought the “Britannia” outright, for
seventy-five thousand dollars, from the London and
Hull Steamship Company. She had done seventeen
knots, and probably could do it again, and was
strongly built, though she was not intended for a
dead weight cargo in deep-sea sailing.</p>

<p>In the eyes of international law carrying arms, or
other contraband, for warring nations is very different
from furnishing munitions of war to rebels,
though the moral principle, as I see it, is the same.
In the first instance, friendly powers, so called, are
glad to furnish the warring nations with guns, with
which they may kill each other off, at a profit to their
own citizens. In this case it is a survival of the
fittest, with the peaceful nations extending their sympathy
to both of the fighters and their aid to the one
with the deepest war chest. On the other hand, the
sale of arms to rebels is forbidden, regardless of the
fact that there can be no revolution without a rebellion,
and that it is only through revolution, which is
simply evolution, that mankind has advanced out of
the so-called dark ages, even though they may have
been, after all, the best. With the rebels, no matter
how lofty the principles they are fighting for, it is
not at all a question of the survival of the fittest, but
the perpetuation of the government that is, no matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
how bad. The “comity of nations” is such a
fearsome bugaboo that those who revolt against the
established order of things, however galling it may
be, are frowned upon by all nations and given no
rights at all. To furnish them with arms is a crime;
a violation of a law which, I am glad to say, I never
have respected.</p>

<p>In the case of Peru and Bolivia and Chile it was a
war of nations, with all of the other powers smiling
approval; therefore no trans-shipment of the cargo,
at Amsterdam, or some other convenient clearing
house, was necessary. Secrecy was required only to
keep from the Chilean Government knowledge of the
fact that arms had been shipped to Peru and, if that
could not be done, to prevent it from discovering the
vessel on which they had been despatched. We got
the cargo aboard without, so far as could be seen,
arousing the suspicion of the Chilean agents, though
there was no doubt in my mind that they knew of
the purchase of the guns. We then took on as much
coal as the ship would carry, including a lot of
smokeless, and got out, ostensibly headed for Japan.
I promptly rechristened the ship the “Salome” and
prepared a set of papers which indicated that we
were bound for Guayaquil, Ecuador, with a general
cargo. We put in at St. Vincent, in the Cape Verde<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Islands, for coal, and, for the same purpose, at Pernambuco
and Montevideo. At the latter port I took
on every pound of coal the ship would hold, including
a deckload, for it was a long run from there to
Callao.</p>

<p>I did not take a chance on going through the narrow
Straits of Magellan, and right past the Chilean
port of Punta Arenas, but went clear around the
Horn. On the way down to the Horn from Montevideo
I stood far out, for I suspected that the Chilanos
might have a ship doing sentry duty at the
lower end of the east coast and, while I had no fear
that she could run me down, I wished to avoid all suspicion.
When we rounded the Horn I headed
straight west for three days, until we were well clear
of the coast and outside of the regular course, and
then steamed due north until we reached the latitude
of Callao. Then we began burning our smokeless
coal and headed in, slowly and cautiously. When
we were twelve or fifteen miles offshore I sighted
the smoke of a vessel coming down from the north,
and, soon afterward, another one approaching from
the south. Experience and that sixth sense which
every successful blockade runner must possess, told
me that they were two of the blockading fleet. I
stayed so far down on the horizon that I could make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
out nothing but their smoke and watched them as
they approached each other, met, and drew apart. I
waited until each of them was, as nearly as I could
calculate it, as far from what my course would be
as I was from the harbor, and then made a dash for it,
taking chances on finding one or two guard ships on
post right in front of the city, and prepared to show
them my heels the moment I sighted them. Luckily,
there were no ships off the harbor nor did either of
the patrol ships sight me, and I sailed up to the government
dock with no more trouble than if I had
been going into Liverpool. The guns were taken out
and I received my money, which was the easiest I
had ever honestly earned, but it was because I understood
the game and had been careful.</p>

<p>While the cargo was being unshipped the blockaders
learned that I had run past them and, to get
even with me, I suppose, they laid in wait for us to
come out. That did not worry me, however. I was
in no particular hurry to leave and waited until they
were weary of watching. Then, on a dark night, I
stole out, hugged the shore to the south and slipped
away from them, without having as much as a hail
thrown at me. I restored the ship to her proper
name and self but took the same course back again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
around the Horn to keep clear of any entangling
alliances with the Chilean warships. I put in at
Buenos Ayres for coal, picked up a cargo for Liverpool,
and on my arrival there resold the ship for a
few thousand dollars less than I had paid for her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>STEALING A BRITISH SHIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the old days, when I was cavorting with contraband
throughout the West Indies and South
America, I ran into one unpleasant incident which
left me with a large moral,—or immoral, according
to the point of view,—obligation on my hands. During
a quiet spell I had bought, at a bargain, a little
schooner at St. Thomas, loaded her with mahogany
at Santo Domingo, and started for Liverpool, to see
what was going on in that part of the world. We
were caught in a heavy gale and were forced to run
into Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, where we arrived in a
sinking condition. On the false charge that my
papers were forged the agent for Lloyds’, with whom
the ship was insured, seized the vessel as I was having
her repaired, and had me arrested for barratry.
I was taken to Halifax, where I was put to considerable
inconvenience in securing bail. I pleaded my
own case and, as soon as I could get a hearing, was
released, but in the meantime the agent for the underwriters
had libelled my ship and sold her at auction,
and her new owners had sent her away to South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
America. It was a downright steal but I did not consider
it worth my while to stay there and fight the
case, so I simply swore to some day make Lloyds’
pay dearly for the loss of my ship, and let it go at
that for the time being.</p>

<p>My last real adventure had ended with the burial
of the “Leckwith,” for there had been nothing thrilling
in the delivery of the arms I had carried to Montenegro
and Peru, and I was hungry for some new
excitement, the very essence and sole enjoyment of
my life. While casting about for something to satisfy
my appetite the recollection of the Yarmouth
outrage came over me and I decided to steal a ship
and let the underwriters pay for her, as partial compensation
for the one they had stolen from me. After
a survey of the available supply, following my return
to London from Peru, late in the Summer of 1879, I
hit on the “Ferret,” a handsome and fairly fast little
passenger steamer belonging to the Highland Railway
Company, which was lying at Gourock Bay on
the Clyde. They would not let her out on a general
charter, which was what I wanted, so I concluded to
charter her for a year for a cruise in the Mediterranean,
with the option of purchase for fourteen thousand
pounds at the end of that time. All of the
negotiations were conducted and the deal closed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
Joe Wilson, my trusted aide, and I was careful to
impress him with the necessity for the insertion of
the option of purchase clause. I had so much confidence
in him that I did not closely examine the
charter papers and not until it was too late did I
discover that he had neglected to cover the one vital
point. My plan was to go back out East and dig up
the guns which Frank Norton and I had buried on
a little island when we left the China Sea, and perhaps,
if I found that I could stand it to revisit the
scenes of the supreme joy and sadness which had
come to me with the discovery of the Beautiful
White Devil, resume the unholy occupation of preying
on the pirates between Singapore and Hong
Kong. I wanted the option of purchase clause
inserted in the charter partly as a sop to my conscience
and partly with the idea that if we were, by
any remote chance, apprehended before we reached
the China Sea, I could announce that I had exercised
my option and was prepared to pay for the ship. I
was not sure that my conscience, for I still had one,
would let me carry the deal through, and I figured
that I could comfort it, if it troubled me too much,
with the assurance that I might really buy the ship
after all, though I am frank to say I had no such
intention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>With the delivery of the charter, in proper form as
I supposed, I made a great show of fitting the ship
out for a yachting cruise, at the same time smuggling
on board two small cannon and a lot of rifles and
ammunition. Lorensen, my old captain, was seriously
ill, so I took on as sailing master a man
named Watkins. He was well recommended but it
later developed that he had a strain of negro blood
and a well-defined streak of yellow. Tom Leigh, one
of my old men, was first officer, and next to him
was George Ross, another new one. We coaled at
Cardiff and cleared for Malaga. We passed Gibraltar
late in the afternoon, as was intended, and signalled
“All well” to the observer for Lloyds’. As soon as
it was dark we headed over toward the other shore
for twelve or fifteen miles and then stood straight out
to sea again. As we made the second change in our
course we stove in a couple of our boats and threw
them overboard, along with a lot of life preservers.
I wanted to make it appear that the “Ferret” had
foundered, and we ran into a heavy blow which dovetailed
beautifully into my scheme. At daylight we
were well clear of Gibraltar but within sight of the
Morrocan coast. I called the crew aft and addressed
them to this effect:</p>

<p>“Taking advantage of the option of purchase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
clause in the charter, I now declare myself the owner
of this ship and will pay for her, as stipulated, at the
end of the period for which she is chartered. We are
going on a very different trip from that for which
you signed. It will be attended by some danger but,
probably, by profits which will more than compensate
you for the risk you run. Those of you who wish to
go with me will receive double pay, a bonus of fifty
dollars for signing new papers, and a share of the
profits from the trip. Those who do not care to go
may take a boat and go ashore.”</p>

<p>Every man agreed to stay with me. I thereupon
rechristened the ship the “India,” a name legitimately
held by a vessel on the other side of the
world, as was indicated by Lloyds’ register, fired a
gun and dipped the flag and declared her in commission.
At the same time I rechristened myself, a
ceremony to which I was equally accustomed, and
took the name of James Stuart Henderson. I presented
the ship with a new log and certificate of
registry and other necessary papers, from the counterfeit
blanks I always carried, and all of the men
signed the new articles. We then headed for Santos,
Brazil, with the idea of keeping clear of British
waters until the loss of the “Ferret” had become an
established fact. On the way the brass plate on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
main beam, showing that the engines were built for
the “Ferret,” was removed, and the new name took
the place of the old one everywhere about the ship.
The chart room and wheelhouse were taken off the
bridge and rebuilt over the wheel amidships. Some
of the upper works were stripped away and the whole
appearance of the vessel was changed to such an
extent that even her builders would hardly have
recognized her.</p>

<p>At Santos I bought outright a cargo of coffee and
headed for Cape Town, South Africa, where I consigned
it to Wm. G. Anderson &amp; Son, with instructions
to sell it for cash, and quickly. On the trip
across the Atlantic, Ross, the second officer, who had
been one of the boldest at first, all at once became
very anxious regarding the outcome of the trip and
his future welfare. Watkins, the sailing master, who
had shown a domineering nature that I did not like,
also hoisted the white feather. Griffin, too, the chief
engineer, displayed some symptoms of cold feet, but
he was a brave man at heart and his trouble was
easily cured. I allowed Ross to return to England
from Cape Town, and Watkins caught the gold fever
and started for Pretoria. I had no fear that either
of them would engage in any unwise talk, for both
had signed forged articles with their eyes wide open.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
I made Leigh sailing master and we cleared light for
Australia, with a short stop at the Mauritius for coal.
We coaled again at Albany, West Australia. From
there we went to Port Adelaide, South Australia,
and then on to Melbourne, where we came to grief.
Off Port Philip Head we signalled for a pilot and
a canny Scot came aboard. He seemed suspicious
of us from the first and I noticed that he was studying
the ship closely as we steamed up to an anchorage
off Williamstown. Two young royal princes
had just arrived on a British fleet and there were
gala goings-on when we entered the harbor.</p>

<p>I landed at once and went to the Civil Service
Club Hotel to recuperate from a bad case of malaria
which I had contracted at the Mauritius. While not
alarmed by the apparent suspicion of the pilot, I was
impressed by it, and gave strict orders to Leigh to
allow no one to come aboard. Leigh’s one weakness
was drink and to guard against his becoming helplessly
intoxicated I instructed Wilson to either
remain on board or visit the ship every day. My
fever grew worse after I went ashore and in two or
three days the doctor decided that I should have a
nurse, as I was all alone. The doctor was with me
when the nurse arrived and as he entered the door
the doctor made a quick movement as though something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
had startled him, and looked from one of us
to the other in amazement. I could not imagine
what had happened until he said: “That man looks
enough like you to be your twin brother. I never
have seen such a resemblance between two men.”</p>

<p>I surveyed the nurse more critically and saw that
we did look strangely alike, even to the scarred face.
He had a scar on his left cheek, whereas mine is on
my right, and it was shorter than mine, but it served
to heighten our resemblance. We could not have
been more alike in build if we had been cast from
the same mould, and any one who did not know us
intimately could easily have been excused for taking
one of us for the other. The nurse said his name
was William Nourse and that he had arrived in Melbourne
only two or three days before from Tasmania,
where he had worked in the Hobartstown hospital.
As we got better acquainted he told me he had had a
run of hard luck in Hobartstown; that his wife had
deserted him and he had taken to drink and lost his
position, and that he had come to Australia to make
a fresh start.</p>

<p>While I was recovering at the hotel events were
transpiring in connection with the ship which tended
to dissuade my spirit from becoming overproud.
Wilson, it developed, soon relaxed his vigilance and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
gave himself up to pleasures ashore but without coming
near me, whereupon old Leigh blithely betook
himself to his beloved bottle. After a few days the
shrewd Scotch pilot paid the ship a friendly visit,
found Leigh full three sheets in the wind, encouraged
him to proceed with his potations until he fell asleep,
and then went over the ship at his leisure, taking
measurements and making observations. Naturally,
her measurements corresponded exactly with those of
the “Ferret,” which had been reported as missing with
a probability that she had gone down in the Mediterranean,
and he reported his suspicions and the result
of his investigation to the authorities. Being a
Scotchman he was not actuated so much by honesty
and a desire that right should prevail as by the
expectation of a substantial reward. The ship was
promptly seized for some technical violation of the
port regulations, which gave the officials an opportunity
to make a detailed inspection and take all of
her measurements, and Leigh and the few members
of the crew who were on board when the seizure
was made were detained there. Leigh refused to say
a word but one or two of the crew, believing the fat
was in the fire and wishing to save their own bacon,
told enough to confirm all of the suspicions that were
entertained regarding us. Leigh was then formally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
placed under arrest and search was instituted for
Wilson and me.</p>

<p>I was greatly surprised when, late one afternoon
about ten days after our arrival at Melbourne, I
received word from Joe that the ship had been recognized
as the “Ferret” and seized, that he had taken
to the bush and that I had better disappear as quickly
and quietly as possible if I wished to escape arrest,
for the officers were looking for both of us. Fearful,
for the first time, that Joe had made a mistake, and
cursing my carelessness, I dug into my papers and
discovered that the charter contained no option of
purchase clause. That made it serious business and
I understood why Joe had taken such precipitate
flight. I knew if I stayed at the hotel my arrest
was only a matter of a few hours and that if I sought
to escape, the chances were that I would be caught,
but I determined to make a try for it. By that time
I was able to be up and walk around my room,
though I had not left it, but I had Nourse pass the
word around the hotel that I had had a serious
relapse and was in such a precarious condition that
I must not be disturbed by visitors nor by any noise
near my rooms.</p>

<p>I told Nourse that a warrant was out for my arrest
on some technical violation of the port regulations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
and that, while I had no fear of the result of a trial,
I did not feel strong enough to go through it, and
therefore I intended to leave at once and secretly and
stay away until the trouble blew over. He agreed
to go with me and soon after dark we left the hotel
quietly by a rear entrance which opened onto an
alley. I left behind all of my luggage except a bag
in which I carried about five thousand, five hundred
pounds in gold and Bank of England notes, and
a few articles of clothing. We engaged a carriage
and drove to a suburb on the railroad running to
Sydney, where we stayed all night, as all of the evening
trains had left. My idea was to get to Sydney
or Newcastle, where I hoped to bribe the captain of
some outgoing ship to take me on board as a stowaway.
We took the morning train and rode as far as
Seymour, about seventy-five miles from Melbourne.
There we hired a rig and drove across country to
Longwood, where we picked up the railroad after it
had passed an important junction point which I
wished to avoid as I feared the officers would be
watching for us there. On the long drive to Longwood
I became convinced that my capture was certain,
for the country was so thinly settled that we
were sure to attract attention and be easily followed,
if we undertook to drive through it, while if I stuck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
to the railroad I was sure to be apprehended. In
seeking some new way out of the dilemma I conceived
the idea of having Nourse take my place. There was
no reason that money could not remove to prevent
him from doing so, for neither of us was known, and
a physical description, such as the police would have,
would fit either of us. I was becoming more and
more apprehensive of danger and as we neared Longwood
I put the proposition up to him.</p>

<p>“What do you say, Nourse, to changing places
with me and letting yourself be arrested, if it comes
to that? I will engage a good lawyer to defend you
and even if you should be convicted, which I doubt,
you would not have to spend more than a few months
in jail, at the most. You are strong and could stand
the confinement, while it would about put me under
the turf. According to your own story there is no
one who cares what trouble you get into, and even
if you went to jail you probably would be as happy
there as anywhere. How much will you take to do
it?”</p>

<p>“I had been thinking of that very thing,” he replied.
“I don’t care much what happens to me, but I am
not exactly hungry for a long term in Pentridge. If
this thing is no worse than you say it is, though, I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
swap places with you and see it through for two
hundred pounds.”</p>

<p>I accepted his terms without argument. He
already knew enough about me so that he could
adopt my identity, without fear of detection except
under a searching inquiry, but I quickly framed up a
life history for him and told him the full and true
story of the “Ferret.” I cautioned him, however, if
he was arrested, to make no statement of any kind
until he had talked with the lawyer I would send to
him. As soon as we reached Longwood we exchanged
clothing, even down to our underwear, socks,
and shoes. Nourse was transformed into James
Stuart Henderson, dressed by Pool of London, and I
became a rather shabbily attired nurse. I paid
Nourse his money, which relieved me of most of my
load of gold, and concealed the rest of my money in
my rough and roomy shoes and under my more or
less dirty garments.</p>

<p>We had just finished dinner and were sitting alone
in the hotel office, rehearsing the part Nourse was
to play, when a sergeant and two officers, who had
got track of us at Seymour, rode up on horseback.
We saw them through the window and I moved back
into the shadow for, though I did not look greatly
unlike Nourse in our changed garb, I did not wish the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
officers to notice our facial resemblance. With only
a glance at me they walked right up to Nourse and
placed him under arrest. He professed amazement
but readily admitted that he was James Stuart Henderson.
He said he was driving through the country,
with a nurse, for his health, having just recovered
from the fever.</p>

<p>The orders of the officers called for the arrest of
only one man so I was not interfered with. They
were after big game and, much to my satisfaction,
considered me hardly worthy of their notice. Still
anxious to avoid close range comparison with
Nourse, I did not return to Melbourne on the same
train with them the next morning, but went down
by the one that followed it. I kept well clear of the
jail to which the bogus Henderson had been hustled
and went to a little hotel on Swanston Street, kept by
a German named Hellwig. The first thing I heard
was that Joe, who had taken the train ahead of me,
had been captured at Albury, where the railroad
crosses the Murray River, which divides Victoria
from New South Wales, and was on his way back, in
charge of an officer, to join Leigh and my counterfeit
presentment behind the bars.</p>

<p>I at once engaged Jarvis, the best barrister in
Australia, to defend them, and later employed Gillette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
&amp; Stanton, another high-class firm, to assist him. I
told them, of course, the real facts, and had them
instruct Leigh and Joe to coach Nourse in the part
he was to play and to maintain the proper attitude
toward him. The moment Leigh saw “Henderson”
he knew there was something wrong somewhere but
he was too shrewd to indicate it and greeted the newcomer
cordially. I had described Leigh to Nourse so
that he could not mistake him and he walked right
up to him and shook hands. When Joe joined them
in jail Leigh got to him first and posted him. They
were charged with conspiracy and barratry and were
indicted, altogether, on seven counts.</p>

<p>Nourse was as game as a hornet and played his part
well, yet he was not born a gentleman and he was
altogether lacking in that <i>savoir faire</i> which is regarded
as a necessary makeup of the typical soldier
of fortune, which Henderson was supposed to be.
George Smyth, the prosecuting attorney, was a
shrewd chap, as well as a gilt-edged sea lawyer, and
it was not long until he began to suspect that he had
a bogus Henderson in limbo and that the real ravisher
of maritime law was still at liberty. Some of
the other officials came to doubt that they had the
right man and this suspicion became so strong by the
time the trial came on that they had detectives out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
quietly searching for the real Henderson. This
information reached the lawyers whom I had
employed, but whom I saw infrequently as I remained
discreetly in the background, and they insisted, as
they had previously suggested, that I go away until
the case was concluded.</p>

<p>“This case is much more serious than you realize,”
said Gillette, as he again urged me to leave Melbourne
for my own protection, or go into close hiding and
stay there. “Unfortunately, Nourse is not nearly so
clever as you. You are damned clever, but you are
not clever enough to avoid being nabbed if you stay
around here while the trial is on.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re wrong,” I told him, “but I’m paying
you for your advice and if it is good enough to
buy it ought to be good enough to take. I’ll go out
and bury myself.”</p>

<p>“Right,” he said. “See that you make a good job
of it.”</p>

<p>“I will,” I replied. “I am going to bury myself
in a real tomb.”</p>

<p>The lawyer looked up a bit startled. “You don’t
mean that you intend to kill yourself?” he asked
with some anxiety.</p>

<p>I laughed at him. “Not much,” I told him. “I
like to explore strange lands but I always want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
come back. If there really are any detectives on my
trail, the last place they will look for me is the cemetery,
and I will go out there and cache myself away
in Sir William Clark’s tomb. It is an ideal hiding
place, so far as security is concerned, and you can
devote all of your thought to the trial, without any
fear that I will be discovered and disarrange things.”</p>

<p>“But people are buried in there,” exclaimed the
man of law with a show of horror which evidenced
great reverence for the dead.</p>

<p>“So much the better for my purpose,” I said, as
I walked out of his office. “I’m off for my tomb.”</p>

<p>The idea of using the Clark tomb, which I had previously
noticed while walking through the cemetery,
as a hiding place, had come to me while the lawyer
was urgently renewing his advice to me to get under
cover until the conclusion of the trial. The mausoleum
was in an out-of-the-way corner of the dead
city and I knew that if I could get inside of it I would
be safe from intrusion. It was about twelve by sixteen
feet in size and was closed with a solid iron door,
but above it was a grating which would furnish
plenty of ventilation.</p>

<p>The landlord of the hotel where I was stopping
had a delightful Dutch daughter, with whom I had
become very friendly, and when I returned there after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
my talk with the lawyer, she informed me that two
men had been around making guarded inquiries
regarding a man answering my description. She
took them for detectives, she said, and without knowing
or suspecting why they were looking for me she
had thrown them off the scent. This convinced me
that there was a chase on, after all, and that it was
getting so hot that I had no time to lose.</p>

<p>With a blanket wrapped about the upper part of
my body, and with the pockets of Nourse’s dirty old
white overcoat stuffed with pilot bread, canned
meats, candles, a dark lantern, and books, I went out
to the cemetery that evening. I had some doubt
about being able to get into the tomb but I succeeded
in picking the lock with a piece of heavy wire and proceeded
to take up my abode with the departed Clarks.
There were three of them and from the sizes of the
caskets I took them to be father, mother, and child.
There was one unoccupied niche and in that I arranged
my bed, with my blanket and Nourse’s
overcoat.</p>

<p>I lived in the tomb for three weeks without arousing
the slightest suspicion that it was occupied. My
surroundings did not worry me at all—in fact I
never had such quiet and orderly companions—and
after I had adapted myself to them I was fairly comfortable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
My meals were simple to a degree that
would have delighted a social settlement worker.
I was accustomed to softer beds, but the change did
me no harm. I did most of my sleeping during the
day, when I could not smoke without fear of being
discovered, and every night, between midnight and
dawn, I took a walk through the cemetery. Twice a
week, at an appointed rendezvous, I met the landlord’s
daughter, who brought me a fresh supply of
canned stuff, bread, and reading matter, and the latest
news of the trial. Twice, toward the last of it, when
I was very hungry I ventured into the outskirts of
the city and filled up at a cheap eating house. During
the early morning and evening I read by the light
of the dark lantern, which was so placed, with the
blanket as a screen, that its rays could not be seen
through the grating over the door. By the time the
trial was well over and I was free to come out I had
fallen into the routine of my new hotel and was so
well situated that, if I could have been assured of
about three square meals a week, I would not have
complained greatly if I had been forced to stay there
six months.</p>

<p>The trial was held before Judge Williams and
resulted in a conviction. I had expected no other
verdict, for with the option of purchase clause missing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
from the charter it was a clear case. The lawyers for
the defence contended, of course, that Henderson
had announced that he had purchased the ship and
that only his illness had prevented him from so advising
her owners, but they could not satisfactorily
explain why he and Wilson had taken to the bush
when the vessel was seized. Nourse was subjected
to a most severe examination by the prosecuting
attorney in an effort to prove that he was not the real
Henderson, but he had been thoroughly coached by
Joe and Leigh and acquitted himself so well that
much of the suspicion which had been entertained
that he was playing a part was removed, but not all
of it.</p>

<p>The crucial moment came when the clerk of the
court called out, “James Stuart Henderson, stand
up,” and Judge Williams asked him if he knew of
any reason why sentence should not be passed upon
him. According to the lawyers, the situation was
intensely dramatic. The judge, the prosecuting
attorney, and all of the more or less skeptical officials,
were boring holes through poor Nourse’s head
with their eyes. He had but to open his mouth to
clear himself and start every officer in Australia on a
hunt for me from which I would have found it hard
to escape, but he was true blue. He looked back at
the judge bravely and simply said, “No, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Nourse and Wilson were sentenced to seven years
and Leigh to three and one-half years in Pentridge
prison. With the time deducted for good behavior,
this meant five years and three months for Nourse
and Joe and less than three years for Leigh. When
the case assumed a more serious aspect than I had
believed it would when I bargained with Nourse to
take my place, I sent word to him that I would pay
him well if he would “play the string out,” and as
soon as I left the tomb I deposited five thousand dollars
which was to be paid to him when he was
released. I spent some time and considerable money
in an effort to secure a pardon for my companions,
but when I found that was impossible I returned to
England, with a promise to be back in Australia by
the time their terms expired. On the long trip back
to London I spent a lot of time in reproaching myself
for the result of the unfortunate cruise. It was the
first mistake I had ever made and, while I was not
primarily to blame, the responsibility was mine, for
I was at fault in not having seen that all of the papers
were in proper form. That experience taught me a
lesson and I never again fell into a blunder of that
sort. The Highland Railway subsequently sold the
“Ferret” to run between Albany and Adelaide.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>A LAND OF MYSTERY AND MURDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH my return to London in the early
eighties, after I had been sent to prison by
proxy for seven years in Australia, the old lure of the
West Indies, with their continuous riot of revolutions,
came over me so strongly that I could not hold out
against it, nor did I try. Frank Norton, my old partner
in piracy, had the “Queen of the Seas” at the East
Indian docks, where he was displaying a ship ventilating
apparatus which he had invented. He urged
me to go back to the China Sea with him and resume
operations against the pirates, but I put him off.
Soon after leaving him I ran into an English engineer
named Tucker, whom I had known in Venezuela,
and from him I learned that Guzman Blanco, the
Dictator, was in Paris, his foreign capital, from
which he was directing the government of Venezuela
through a dummy President, and was anxious to see
me. I was not particularly desirous of seeing him,
however, for I feared I could not resist him, and I
had no wish to again be tied down in Caracas, as I
had been before when I was his confidential agent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
I was much more interested in reports which reached
me, through contraband channels, that a new revolution
was shaping up in Costa Rica, and that there
was a prospect of trouble in Hayti and even in
Venezuela.</p>

<p>I took the first ship for Halifax and went from
there to St. John, New Brunswick, where I bought
the fore and aft schooner “George V. Richards.” She
was a trim-looking craft of about one hundred and
eighty tons, and stanch, but, as I discovered later,
as faddish as an old maid. We never could trim her
to suit her and she never behaved twice the same
under similar conditions. In the same weather she
would settle back on her stern like a balky mule or
sail like a racing yacht, just as the spirit moved her.
Yet I was fond of her, for she was a great deal like
myself; she had her wits about her all of the time
and was at her best in an emergency. I took her to
Bridgeport, Connecticut, where I loaded up with old
Sharps and Remington rifles and a lot of ammunition,
and, after burying them under sixty tons of coal,
sailed for Venezuela to see what was going on in
Guzman’s absence.</p>

<p>Instead of going direct to La Guaira, where I was
well known, I headed for Maracaibo, the city that
gave Venezuela its name. Alonzo de Ojeda, who followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
Columbus, sailed westward along the coast of
Terra Firme, which the Great Discoverer had spoken
of as “the most beautiful lands in the world,” to
the Gulf of Maracaibo. There he found several
Indian villages built on piles and, prompted by this
suggestion, he named the land Venezuela, or “Little
Venice.” Maracaibo has a splendid harbor for light-draft
vessels, and but for the fact that it has been
subject to the whims of successive plundering presidents
it would now be the chief city of the country.
Not only is it the port of a great and rich section of
Venezuela, but it is the only outlet for the coffee and
other products of a large part of Colombia. Ever
since their separation there has been ill-feeling
between the two republics, and it has suited the fancy
of every Venezuelan president since Guzman’s day,
Castro being the chief offender, to spasmodically
shut off all communication with Colombia, with consequent
disastrous effects to the trade of Maracaibo.
As a partial offset to these recurrent embargoes, the
city boasts of a brand of yellow fever that has
actually made it famous, at least among travellers in
South America. It is so mild that it is seldom fatal
and wise folks who are ticketed for the interior of
Venezuela go to Maracaibo and stay until they have
had the fever and become immune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>The collector of customs at Maracaibo “borrowed”
a fine rifle from me, which is one of the South American
varieties of graft, and put me up at the club,
where I was thrown in friendly contact with the
people I wished to meet. I found that General Alcantara
was acting as dummy President while Guzman
was enjoying himself in Europe, and I soon satisfied
myself, from remarks dropped by his friends in
response to my guarded inquiries, that he was ambitious
to become the ruler of Venezuela in fact as well
as in name. The movement to overthrow Guzman
was, in fact, taking definite form, and I sold a part
of my arms to Alcantara’s friends. They wanted to
buy the entire cargo, but I refused to part with it,
on the ground that the bulk of it had been contracted
for elsewhere. It was apparent that serious trouble
was brewing for Guzman and, instead of proceeding
to Costa Rica, I sailed for La Guaira, intending to
visit Caracas and look the situation over at close
range.</p>

<p>At the capital there was the same undercurrent of
revolt against the dictatorship of Guzman, which was
being secretly encouraged by the partisans of the acting
President. I called at the Yellow House to pay
my respects to Alcantara, whom I had known in Guzman’s
army, and in the course of our conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
he suggested that I remain in Caracas and become
his friend, as I had been Guzman’s. He did not tell
me of his real ambition in so many words, but I
needed no binoculars to see what was in his mind. I
at once wrote Guzman fully, telling him of Alcantara’s
treachery and describing the situation as I had
found it, and then sailed for Costa Rica. Guzman
had also heard of what was going on through other
sources and, as I subsequently learned, he returned
to Venezuela a few months later, before the revolt
that was being hatched had broken its shell. The
government was promptly turned over to him by
Alcantara, who at once started to leave the country,
evidently fearing that if he remained he would be
summarily sent to San Carlos, then as now the
unhappy home of political prisoners. He started for
La Guaira by the old post road, along which were a
number of public houses. In one of these he met a
party of politicians and while with them he died
suddenly. It was charged by Alcantara’s friends that
he was poisoned by order of Guzman, who suspected
that he was going away to launch a revolution, but
the friends of Guzman claimed that he ate heartily
of rich salads while in a heated condition and died
from acute indigestion. The latter version of it has
always been my view, for Guzman was not the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
to have an enemy, nor even a friend who had played
him false, put out of the way in such fashion. Guzman
was a dictator to his finger tips, but he was
nothing of a murderer.</p>

<p>The Costa Ricans were, I found, making one of
their periodical but always futile efforts to depose
their President, General Tomaso Guardia, and I had
no difficulty in disposing of my arms and ammunition,
which I exchanged for a cargo of coffee. I
might have joined the revolution had I not become
convinced that it had no more chance of success than
those which had preceded it. Gen. Guardia, who
ruled until he died, was one of the few strong men
Central America has produced. He was the Diaz
of Costa Rica and as much of a dictator as Guzman
Blanco, whom he greatly resembled in his friendship
for foreigners and his contempt for the natives.
When he heard of a political leader, so called, who
was trying to stir up trouble, Gen. Guardia would
send for him and say: “Your health has not been
good for some time. I see that you are failing. You
need a long trip. Go to Europe and stay a year,” or
two years or five, according to circumstances. A
couple of trusted lieutenants were assigned to stay
with the politely condemned exile, “to see that he
wanted for nothing,” and he never failed to take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
next ship for foreign shores. Another presidential
method was to summon some discontented one, who
was planning an insurrection, and make him a member
of the Cabinet. Flattered by this honor the new
Minister was easily tempted to come out with exaggerated
expressions of confidence in Gen. Guardia
and his government. Thereupon the President would
kick him into the street. “There,” he would say to
the natives, “you see, all that man wanted was
money. He is nothing of a patriot.”</p>

<p>Guardia always smiled, whether he was sentencing
a man to exile or ejecting him from his shifting
Cabinet; he regarded the natives as only children.
By such methods as these he made himself master of
the country, and the little rebellions which sprang
up from time to time were quickly suppressed. One
of the foreigners for whom he developed a great
liking was Dr. W. R. Bross, a New York physician
who was at Port Limon with a party of engineers
who were building a railroad from the coast into the
interior. While on a visit to Port Limon the President
discovered that Dr. Bross had much more skill
than any of the physicians at the capital. He wanted
him to go to Europe with him and, when this proposition
was rejected, urged him to accompany him to
San Jose, the capital, and become his private physician,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
at a salary he was to name himself. This offer
was also turned down. Had Dr. Bross been more
worldly, and less devoted to the men who were in his
care, he could have secured concessions worth millions
of dollars, for Gen. Guardia was more than generous
to his friends.</p>

<p>I suspected that the coffee I received had been
stolen from planters who were loyal to the government,
and that the rebels had “levied” on it as a war
tax, but as they charged me three cents less a pound
than the market price, while I charged them four or
five times as much for the arms and ammunition as
they cost me, I had no compunctions of conscience
about taking it. It is a waste of good time and precious
protoplasm to sympathize with Central or South
Americans who are pillaged by rebels, for in the
next uprising the victims of the previous one will, in
their turn, be the plunderers. Thanks to the meddling
of American warships, things have quieted down
a great deal within recent years, but in the good old
days, of which I am writing, revolutions were as
much a part of the daily life of the people in those
countries as their morning meal, and more so than
their morning bath. In fact, the most popular morning
salutation was, “Who are we revoluting for [or
against] to-day?” Few went further and asked why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
they were in revolt, for that was a minor consideration
and there were not many who knew.
At least nine-tenths of the steady routine of
revolutions were due to nothing more than personal
ambition, which has been the curse of Latin
America. Some man of influence or a disgruntled
general who had helped to elevate some other general
to the presidency, and then had not been shown
the consideration to which he thought himself entitled,
would raise the standard of rebellion. Under a
plethora of promises as to what he would do when
he became president, he would attract other dissatisfied
ones to his cause, and it usually was only a question
of time until he overturned the unstable government.
Then he would, in turn, be unable or
unwilling to make good on all of his promises, real
or implied, and those whom he disappointed would
proceed to throw him out. Every man of importance
had a following of ignorant natives who, either
because they had grown up in his section of the
country and had been taught to show him homage,
or because they expected to lead lazy lives when he
became all-powerful, would follow him blindly. A
revolution which involved any question of good government
was almost unheard of. It is nothing but
the inordinate and, among the upper classes, almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
unanimous thirst for power that has retarded the
development of these rich countries for generations.
Blessed by nature beyond the understanding of those
who have not spent years in them, they have been
cursed by man. When they have become civilized
and their development once sets in, it will eclipse anything
America has ever seen.</p>

<p>But these observations are not a part of my story.
With the cargo of loyalist coffee we headed for New
Orleans. We made bad weather of it all of the way.
The faddish ship wouldn’t sail or heave to and was
as cranky as an old man in his dotage. Some days
we actually went backward, and it was a long time
before we raised South Pass light and were picked
up by a tug. The moment the hawser tightened the
old ship threw herself back on her haunches and
refused to budge. The captain of the towboat, after
struggling strenuously to get us under way, dropped
back and screamed at me, “What in hell is the
matter with that damned old hooker?”</p>

<p>“You don’t know how to tow and she knows it,”
I retorted.</p>

<p>“One would think you had all the anchors in the
United States down,” he shouted.</p>

<p>I assured him that we didn’t have even one down
and he tried it again and finally got us to going.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
We were off quarantine soon after sundown and discovered
that an embargo of forty days against Central
American ports had been raised only an hour
before. The balkiness of the “Richards” had prevented
us from having to ride at anchor for days or
weeks and be subjected to casual inspection and gossip
which might have caused trouble. While the delay
had been of service to us in that respect it provoked
some anxiety on another point. I had an idea that
the Costa Rican Government might try to have the
ship seized, and our trip had been such a long one
that no time was to be lost in selling our cargo and
getting away. I took samples of the coffee to New
Orleans on a tug and placed them in the hands of
old Peter Stevens, of the Produce Exchange, who
sold the whole cargo in an hour.</p>

<p>While the coffee was coming out stores were going
in, and we were out of the river again and on our way
to Hayti in record time. Though I had good cause
to remember Santo Domingo I never had been in the
“Black Republic,” and as I had heard there was a
probability of some lively times there I determined
to visit it before I returned to New York. But the
crankiness of the “Richards” interfered with my
plans. When we were about one hundred miles west
of Key West the old ship committed suicide by burning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
herself to death. The fire started in the hold
amidships, but we could not even imagine what might
have caused it. It was so unexpected that it had a
good start before we discovered it. We fought it,
of course, but we might as well have tried to quench
a volcano in eruption. The strange craft had made
up her mind to go under, and there was nothing for
us to do but take to the whaleboat, which was large
enough for all of us, as I had only a small crew. After
we had shoved off we returned at considerable risk
to rescue a big black cat which was on the ship when
I bought her. We had christened him “John Croix,”
and every man on board undertook to teach him all
he knew about navigation, with the result that the
animal had become so highly educated that he could do
everything about the ship but use the sextant.</p>

<p>Our humanity was well rewarded, for John saved
our lives, or at least saved us from a lot of suffering.
A stiff norther came up before we sighted land and
for several days we were tossed about without any
clear idea as to the direction in which we were being
blown, for not once did we get a glimpse of sun or
moon by which to take a reckoning. Eventually we
drifted among the islands to the westward of Key
West, and we headed for the largest one in sight. In
the heavy sea that was running we made a bad mess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
of the landing. Our boat was overturned and stove
in, the bung came out of the water cask, and all of
our supplies and most of our instruments were lost.
We got ashore all right, and John Croix with us, but
we had neither food nor water, and when a search
of the little island failed to reveal so much as a
sign of a spring of fresh water, we began to give
some thought to what our chances would be in the
hereafter. We bivouacked gloomily that night on
the beach. Early in the morning the cat awakened
me by rubbing against my face. At first I thought
he was only depressed, like the rest of us, and wanted
company, but he pestered around until I got up and
followed him. Calling to me over his shoulder he
led the way to a clump of mangrove trees, whose
roots overhung the bank three feet above high tide.
John trotted under the mass of roots and began to
purr loudly. I started to follow him and then backed
out, but the cat yowled so loudly that I got down
on all fours again and followed him. I crawled along
for ten or twelve feet until I found John standing
over a rivulet of fresh water about as big as my finger.
I drank my fill from it and then awakened the others
and told them of John’s discovery. They hailed him
as our saviour, and when he came trotting into camp
a couple of hours later with an oyster in his mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
they were ready to beatify him. Until John had
shown us the way to food, as he had led us to water,
we had not thought of looking for oysters, of which
there were millions around the roots of the mangrove
trees. Strengthened and encouraged we patched up
our boat and, when the storm had blown itself out,
put to sea again and encountered a little schooner
from St. John’s, Florida, which took us to Key West,
where we soon got a ship for New York. On the
way north we put in at Charleston, where I had
enjoyed much excitement as a blockade runner, and
there I presented John Croix to a Methodist minister
who promised to give him a good home.</p>

<p>I was still anxious to visit Hayti, that land of
mystery and murder, and, in the guise of an English
planter, I went there on a West Indian steamer.
Hayti has had more internal troubles and more
presidents than any other of the revolutionary republics
and her domestic disorders will continue until
they are stopped by some powerful outside influences,
for the blacks and mulattoes are eternal enemies. In
the first three years following the separation from
Santo Domingo there were four presidents. In 1849
Soulouque, a negro, proclaimed himself Emperor, as
Faustian I. He ruled with despotic power, renewed
the war on Santo Domingo, and played hob generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
with the nation’s finances and affairs. In 1858
General Geffrard, a mulatto whom Soulouque had
condemned to death, revolted and proclaimed himself
President. He restored the constitution and held on
until 1867, when he was overthrown by General Salnave,
who lasted three years before he was deposed
and shot. He had four successors in twice as many
years, the last one being General Salomon, who was
at the head of affairs when I arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>It did not take me long to make up my mind that
Hayti was the warmest hotbed of intrigue I had ever
run across and I felt that I was among friends and
in a thoroughly congenial atmosphere. The very air
seemed to breed revolutions; perhaps because it was
peopled with the spirits of the old buccaneers who
had their headquarters at the western end of the
island in the entrancing early days. There were
many plotters for the presidency, but there were two
great rival camps, one headed by General F. D. Legitime
and the other by General Florville Hippolyte.
Legitime was planning to overturn the government
at once, but it was the scheme of Hippolyte, who was
more cunning and willing to wait, to continue Salomon
in power until the election of 1886, when he
expected to secure his own election as Constitutional
President. All of the plots and counter-plots were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
laid in secret, of course, yet all men of influence
knew in a general way what the others were doing
and where they stood, with due allowance for the
treachery always found in Latin countries, which
creates a delightful element of uncertainty.</p>

<p>Hippolyte was one of the ugliest negroes I have
ever known—and my estimate of him as here set
down is in no way influenced by the fact that some
years later he arranged to have me carefully murdered.
With his bloodshot eyes and white whiskers,
which latter reminded one of dirty lace curtains,
his cruel face was suggestive of some wild animal.
He was abrupt and domineering in his manner and
there was not a forgiving drop of blood in his veins.
If the hippopotamus is as savage a brute as has been
pictured, Hippolyte should have taken all of his name
from that animal. He could laugh, but only like a
hyena, and it was impossible for him to smile. Brutal
and bloodthirsty, he was at the same time a forceful
old villain and possessed of much native shrewdness.
Like all of the blacks he was a devout voodoo
worshipper, and with the aid of the <i>papalois</i>—the
priesthood of the cannibalistic creed—he played on
the superstitions of the ignorant negroes. We became
well acquainted during the year or more that
I loafed around Port au Prince, revelling in the oddly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
warlike surroundings and watching the budding
plots, and at times I found him interesting.</p>

<p>Legitime was the opposite of Hippolyte in all of
his qualities. He was a bright, intelligent, progressive
mulatto; well educated for a Haytien and with a
good address and the manners of a gentleman.
Intense loyalty was one of his strongest characteristics
and he had visions of his country’s immediate
future which have not yet, after twenty-five years,
been in any degree realized. No one questioned his
bravery, and while he to some extent lacked firmness
and strength of character, I believed he would develop
these vital traits with age, for he was then a comparatively
young man. He had the elements of a
first-class president, and had he ever become firmly
established in that office Hayti would to-day be a
very different country and a much more agreeable
neighbor.</p>

<p>In the end I allied myself with Legitime, and in
so doing incurred the bitter enmity of Hippolyte, who
had told me something of his plans and had even
gone so far as to suggest, without going into details,
that I coöperate with him when the time for action
arrived. The result was that when I went over to his
hated rival he took it as a deadly insult, and the
chances are that we would have taken a few shots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
at each other if my stay in the country had not been
cut short. I was negotiating with Legitime to supply
him with arms and take a commission in his
army, and we were getting along famously toward
a real revolution when suddenly, in the latter part of
1884, President Salomon ordered that he be expelled
from the country for plotting against him. If Legitime
had been less popular he would have been
unceremoniously shot, but Salomon’s influence was
already beginning to wane and he did not care to
add largely to his enemies, so he contented himself
with an order of expulsion. At the same time,
through the instrumentality of Hippolyte, the suggestion
was conveyed to me that the climate of Hayti
was not suited to my health. Legitime boarded a
ship for Jamaica, which was conveniently in the harbor
when his expulsion was announced, and I accompanied
him. He told me the time was not ripe for
his revolt and that he proposed to wait until the conditions
were more favorable for him. As a matter of
fact he waited four years, and while he succeeded in
overthrowing Salomon in the end, his rule was short-lived.
I remained with him in Kingston for some
time and then, as I saw no prospect of quick action,
returned to Australia, by way of London, where I
resumed my British name of George MacFarlane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>I reached Melbourne in 1885, after an absence of
about four years, and went to Menzies’ Hotel, which
was not the one I had stopped at before, when I was
James Stuart Henderson. Of my three companions
who had been sent to prison for stealing the “Ferret,”
Leigh, the sailing master, had recently completed
his term, while Nourse, who impersonated me, and
Joe Wilson, had still nearly two years to serve. I
located Leigh and put him to work for Nevins, a sail
maker, and sent word to the others that I was there
and would wait around until they came out. Then,
fearing that I might be recognized by some of the
officers who had suspected, during the trial, that
Nourse was playing a part, with the probable result
that I would be forced to again change places with
him, which I had no wish to do, I went on to Sydney.
There I met Montfort &amp; Co., merchants and speculators,
through whom I became financially interested
in a group of silver properties known as the Sunny
Corner Mines, in the Broken Hills district in New
South Wales. We also laid claim to Mount Morgan,
deceptively described as “A Mountain of Gold,”
which was partly in Queensland. We plunged heavily
on a question of title, which was in litigation, and
stood, as we thought, to make many millions. When
the decision of the highest court was finally announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
the bottom fell out of our scheme, for we
were knocked out at every point, and there was a
void in my bank account which represented considerably
more than one hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>From the time of my first visit to Australia the
laboring men had been conducting an anti-Chinese
agitation, to perpetuate and strengthen their power
over capital. There were not then, nor are there now,
nearly enough workers in the country to supply the
demand. The native blacks are without question the
laziest people under the sun. The notoriously indolent
West Indian negro is an enterprising and ambitious
citizen by comparison with them, for there is
no power on earth by which they can be made to
work. The Chinese, always on the lookout for a
labor market, soon heard of the rich field and invaded
it in droves, whereupon the white workmen of
all grades set up a great hullabaloo; it was there I
first heard the cry of the “Yellow Peril.” The employers,
fearful of antagonizing their employees,
either joined with them or let them have their own
way. They urged England to put a stop to the importation
of Chinese and when the mother country,
which was extending its “sphere of influence”
(meaning thereby the acquisition of territory) further
and further into the Celestial Empire, declined to act,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
Victoria and New South Wales took the matter into
their own hands and passed a Chinese exclusion law.
It provided that any ship captain who brought Chinese
into these Provinces should be compelled to
return them, forfeit his certificate, and pay a fine of
not more than three hundred pounds for each
“Chinkie,” and he might also be sent to jail. Chinese
were further prohibited from entering the restricted
districts by the overland route, and while it was impossible
to entirely shut them out, it was thought
the new law would greatly reduce the number that
entered the country.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that I might recoup my mining
losses by importing Chinamen, without running any
considerable risk of arrest, and I went into the business.
It promised to be profitable, for the natural
effect of the exclusion law was to intensify the desire
of the “Chinkies” to get into the two Provinces,
where the demand for them was the greater on
account of their restricted number. I bought the old
mission ship “Southern Cross,” which took Bishop
Selwyn to Australia, a fore and aft schooner of about
two hundred tons, and sent her across the bay to
Balmain to be overhauled and put in shape for her
new purpose. I had her fitted up as a private yacht,
but all of her fittings below decks were so arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
that they could be knocked down and stored away,
leaving the hold open. On the first trip to China I
had tiers and rows of berths built on the same quickly
removable principle, and with this arrangement there
was enough space to enable us to carry more than
two hundred passengers without discomfort.</p>

<p>I brought Leigh up from Melbourne and made him
sailing master and again began preying on the
Chinkies, but in a more friendly way than when I
was plundering their pirate junks in the China Sea.
The Chinamen furnished their own food, and Quong
Tart, a rich Chinese merchant of Sydney, paid me
one hundred and fifty dollars for every one I landed in
Victoria or New South Wales. He arranged for their
shipment, so, when I arrived at Amoy or Shanghai,
where they all came from, I had only to wait for the
requisite number to come on board, and he also took
charge of them when they were put ashore. In a
spirit of dare-deviltry I landed the first shipload less
than five miles north of Newcastle, the second largest
city in New South Wales. The subsequent cargoes
I unloaded on the beach north of Newcastle or south
of Sydney, without ever feeling that I was in any
serious danger of being discovered. Each time I sent
word to Quong Tart where the next load would be
put ashore and about the time I was expected he sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
spies to the spot to see if any officers were hanging
around and signal to me if there was danger of running
into a trap. No two cargoes were ever landed at
the same place and only Quong Tart knew where to
look for me on the next trip. When Nourse and
Wilson were released from prison the former scurried
across Bass Strait to his old Tasmanian home with
the money I had paid him for so successfully impersonating
me. He considered that he had been
well compensated for his compulsory retirement from
active life and expected to invest his capital in some
small business, to which affluent position, under ordinary
conditions, he never could have aspired with any
degree of confidence. Wilson’s disposition was to
go back to the sea with me, so I bought the “Nettie
H,” a handy little steamer, and put her into the Chinese
smuggling trade. I took command of the
steamer, with Leigh as sailing master, and put Wilson
in charge of the schooner, as I could trust him
with the least anxiety. He had none of Leigh’s love
for liquor and the result of his carelessness with the
“Ferret” had made him as careful as a Scot. While
the “Nettie H” was being fitted out, the authorities
warned me that they knew what I was up to and it
would go hard with me if they secured proof of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
suspicions, but, knowing they were only shooting in
the air, I laughed at them.</p>

<p>If this business of carrying Chinese under cover
had been as productive of adventure as it was of
profits, I would have stuck to it indefinitely, but it
was so absolutely devoid of excitement that it palled
on me. After we had made eight or nine trips, which
more than repaid my financial losses ashore, I withdrew
from the trade, with the idea of returning to the
seductive West Indies, where I imagined there were
higher-class operations to be conducted, and more
thrilling times to be found. While I was disposing of
my ships and finally closing up my Australian affairs,
I was in Sydney for several weeks and stopped at the
Imperial Hotel, where I met and became well acquainted
with Guy Boothby, the English novelist.
Though he dreamed away his inborn love of adventure,
while I industriously practised mine and made
it my life, he was a good deal of a kindred spirit, and
in the course of our numerous long talks I told him
enough about my experience with the Beautiful
White Devil, without going into any of the detailed
and intimate facts which have been told in these
confessions, so that he subsequently wove a romance
about her, using her sobriquet as a title for the story.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Leigh and Wilson, who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
going only as far as England, I boarded a steamship
for London, on my way back to New York. It would
have been easier and quicker for me to have returned
by way of San Francisco, but I involuntarily selected
the roundabout way, to soon find that it led me
into a unique and altogether unexpected experience.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>ADVENTURES ON THE NILE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN I finally forsook Australia, near the close
of 1889, accompanied by Leigh and Wilson,
who had paid a penitentiary penalty for my revengeful
ambition and their own carelessness, I was in no particular
hurry to get anywhere, but had no thought of
stopping off at any point short of London until we
reached Alexandria. Immediately on our arrival
there I was suddenly seized with a freak of fancy, as
we nonchalantly speak of the immutable decrees of
Fate when we wish to show an independence of action
we do not feel, to visit Cairo, and without waste of
time and energy in mental argument I sent my dunnage
ashore by one of the thousand or more small
boats which viciously assaulted the ship from all
sides. My two companions, after their trying times
in Melbourne, were anxious to get back among their
own people, so they went on to London, which decision
was reached without the slightest effort to
conceal their comments on my erratic disposition,
while I proceeded to the ancient capital of the Kings
of Egypt—those glorious old marauding monarchs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
who made despotism a fine art and graft a religion.
There I was projected into a most alluringly adventurous
undertaking. Though failing utterly of its
high purpose, it was by no means devoid of compensations,
for it initiated me far enough into the
mysteries of departed days so that I considered myself
at least an entered apprentice, and, furthermore,
it carried me into close relationship with an exquisitely
beautiful woman, which, next to plotting against
peace and fighting out the plan, is always the thing
most to be desired. As a matter of fact it is the rule
in the Orient, where man is less virile and more
devious and discreet than in the newer world, that
a handsome woman is a part of every properly promoted
plot, and this one was no exception.</p>

<p>Under my British name of George MacFarlane I
stopped at Shepheard’s Hotel, then the home of all
pilgrims, and gave myself up to the enjoyment of
new scenes while I waited, in no sense impatiently,
for the development of the situation through whose
coming I had been summoned. It was at the height
of the tourist season, following the Christmas holidays,
and there was an abundance of company, made
up of cultured Europeans and a few Americans of
gentle birth, for that was before Cairo was over-run
with the over-rich. The time was delightfully whiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
away for a month before anything happened to indicate
the reason for my being there, but within less
than half of that time I had renewed acquaintance
with the man who was really the key to the situation,
though I did not suspect it at the time. He and I
had been strangely thrown together some years before,
under conditions which provoked rather an intimate
knowledge of each other, and when we met on the
street one day the recognition was instant and
mutual. He did not inquire into my business but
simply asked what name I was travelling under, in
order that he might not embarrass me. He stood in
close and confidential relation to Tewfik Pasha, the
Khedive, and on that account it is best that there
should be no hint, even now, as to his name or
nationality.</p>

<p>I wished to see the titular ruler of Egypt at close
range, and through my old companion-in-arms I
secured an invitation to the Khedive’s annual ball
at the Abdin Palace. This function, which naturally
was the event of the year, was rendered impressive
by all the artistry of the East, and it was a most
brilliant spectacle. At the ends of every step in the
long stairway leading up to the palace stood immobile
footmen, who suggested past glories despite their
costume, which was decidedly English, save for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
ever-present fez. Inside, there was an endless succession
of long mirrors set in the walls, which multiplied
the jewels of the women and the gay uniforms
of the officers and diplomats into a flashing mass of
colors; countless palms scattered profusely through
the large rooms, and gorgeous chandeliers illuminated
with candles, but there was not so much as a hint
of furniture. Had there been any place where the
guests could lounge or sit, beyond the floor, the
chances are that some of them would have stayed
there until the next day, at least, in the absence of
physical violence as an aid to their departure. The
only ladies present were Europeans and some few
favored Americans, but from wide corridors behind
the musharabiyeh, or fretwork around the frieze
of the walls, the Khedivah and her women attendants
had a good view of the proceedings without danger
of being seen. They were equally secure from any
possibility of intrusion, for every avenue that led in
their direction was guarded by offensively haughty
eunuchs.</p>

<p>I was purposely close to the end of the long line
of people who were presented to the Khedive, for I
wanted to study him. He was about five and a half
feet tall, with straight black hair, black moustache,
an olive complexion, brown eyes that were more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
alert, and a rather Roman nose, giving a Jewish cast
to his face, which always wore a very bored expression
except when he was interested. His hand
was small but firm—such a hand as would commit
murder if the owner were sure it would not be found
out. There was nothing of the brave man in his
looks or actions. Polite and insinuating by nature,
he was never born to lead. Rather, he suggested the
favorite and tool of the Sultan, who would take some
small chance of losing his head with a sufficiently
large reward in the other side of the scale. He wore
that night, and always, a single-breasted frock coat,
like that of an Episcopal clergyman. He spoke
English correctly but with an accent, and aversion
as well; French he loved and spoke like a Parisian.
I had been given advance information on this point,
so when I was introduced, following a string of
Englishmen and Americans, I addressed him in
French. Instantly the weary look vanished and his
face lighted up until he became almost handsome.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he exclaimed, as he gripped my hand with
more force than I had previously seen him display,
“you are a Frenchman. I am delighted.”</p>

<p>I made some polite reply and he went on, almost
excitedly, “I love the French language, but I do not
like the English. I speak it only because I have to.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
The Khedivah is more fortunate. She does not speak
it at all, and she never will learn it.”</p>

<p>We exchanged commonplaces for a moment and
I passed on, wondering to what extent England could
trust this man, who hated her tongue and made no
secret of it.</p>

<p>Cairo has been described so often and in so many
ways by people who had nothing better to write
about that I have no wish to add to the literature on
that subject, but I cannot refrain from speaking, in
passing, of one unusual scene which, so far as I have
read, has for all of these years escaped the attention
of literary loiterers. With my mind far back in centuries
that are forgotten, in lands devoid of imperishable
monuments like those around me, I had stayed
on the summit of Cheops so long, one afternoon, that
my dragoman declared I would have trouble in reaching
the bottom before dark. Half-way down I paused
for a glimpse at Cairo, with every minaret standing
out boldly in the strong light. Then, suddenly,
almost at my feet, the sinking sun created the shadow
of the Great Pyramid, and it began to move. It advanced
almost imperceptibly, at first, but gathered
headway quickly and in a moment it was rushing
across the twelve-mile plain toward the city with the
speed of an express train, as it seemed to me; I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
sure no race horse could have kept pace with it. When
the shadow reached the Mokattam Hills it paused
for an instant and then began, slowly and more slowly
and with apparent difficulty, to climb the high side of
the Citadel Mosque. When it was half-way up the
wall the sun dropped out of sight like a shot and we
were buried in Egyptian darkness, which, be it said,
is no simple figure of speech. In a few minutes, however,
we were able to complete our descent of the
gigantic steps by the light of the brilliant afterglow,
which spread its soft radiance over the land.</p>

<p>As I was enjoying my after-dinner cigar one evening
in a quiet corner of the garden in front of the
hotel, I was approached by three women pedlers,
apparently of the fellah class. They wore the
common blue kimono-like garment, held together
seemingly by luck, and their small black veils were
thrown over their heads, leaving their faces bare and
thus placing them outside the pale of Egyptian respectability.
I was about to walk away to avoid
their pestering, when my eyes met those of the one
who was in the lead, and instantly I was attracted in
place of being repelled. Great, brilliant eyes they
were; not fickle and flirtatious, like those of the thinly
veiled beauties of the harem who were seen in their
coupes on the Shoobra Road every afternoon, nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
sullen or sensuous, like those of the class to which her
garb gave her claim; but steady and sincere, wide-open
and frank, and in them shone a light that converted
into specks the lanterns with which the
grounds were illuminated. Such eyes do not come in
one generation, not even by chance, nor are they
born of the soil. Her face was of the pure Egyptian
type, gentle in its contour and refined in every line,
with perfectly arched eyebrows and a mass of hair
as black as her eyes, and her easy carriage emphasized
the grace of her tall, lithe figure, the curves of
which not even her coarse robe could entirely conceal.</p>

<p>Her sparkling eyes, turned full on me and ignoring
all else, told me as plainly as words could have done
that she had some message for me, and, suspecting
that the moment for which I had been waiting for
weeks had arrived, I walked slowly toward her, as
though in a mood to barter. As we met, seemingly
somewhat disconcerted by my steady gaze of profound
and unconcealed admiration, she drew her
uncouth veil across her face and held out her hands,
like one trained to tourist trade, that I might examine
her wonderful rings. Those hands could never have
known work, they were so soft and small, and arms
more perfectly rounded were never modelled in marble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
by a master. Plainly this woman was not of the
servant class, to which her companions as clearly
belonged. One of her hands was half-closed and as
she laid it in mine it opened and a small piece of
folded paper fell into my palm. Long accustomed to
ways out of the ordinary, I gave no sign, beyond an
involuntary start which she felt but no one else
noticed, and proceeded with outward calmness, and
assuredly with much deliberation, to select a ring,
which I purchased as a souvenir of our first meeting.
It was set with an uncut ruby in a band of gold so
fine that it was removed from her tiny finger, which
it encircled nearly twice, simply by pressing the ends
outward. Not a word passed between us except as
to the price of the ring, over which there was no
haggling. The women who were with her made a
pretence of showing me their wares, but it was only
a show for the benefit of any inquisitive persons who
might be watching, and without urging me to buy
they passed on. I strolled after them and was interested
in observing that as they approached other
guests the woman who had slipped me the note remained
in the background, with her face veiled,
leaving commerce to her companions. They attempted
to make only a few sales and then disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>Curious to a degree that surprised me, as to the
contents of the communication which had come to
me so strangely, but fearful of being watched, by I
knew not whom, it was some time before I went to
my room to read the note by the light of a tallow
candle. The mysterious missive read: “You are
Captain Boynton. Are you willing to undertake a
difficult and perhaps dangerous mission? Answer
to-morrow night through the channel by which you
receive this.”</p>

<p>Here was a romantic promise of something new
and real in the way of excitement, for I could imagine
nothing stereotyped growing out of such an unusual
beginning, and I rejoiced. The answer to the inspiring
invitation, which I promptly burned from
discretion while sentiment told me to keep it, required
no thought, and as I am not much given to the exertion
of energy in seeking solutions for difficult
problems that will soon supply their own answers, I
did not greatly concern myself as to the purpose of
the plot in which I was sought as a partner. Inasmuch
as the only man in Cairo who knew me as
Captain Boynton, and who was acquainted with my
favorite occupation, was a confidant of the Khedive,
it naturally occurred to me that the oily Tewfik
Pasha was mixed up in it in some way, and I suspected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
that it involved another secret movement
against British rule in Egypt. The latter suspicion
was soon verified and there never has been any doubt
in my own mind that I was equally correct in the
conjecture as to the participation, or at least the
silent approval, of Tewfik, but this could not be
proved.</p>

<p>Knowing the mystery-loving nature of the Egyptians
and feeling sure that if left wholly to their own
ways they would entertain themselves with a long
correspondence which could do no good and might
arouse suspicion, I determined to bring matters to
a head as quickly as possible. It was evident that
those who sought my services knew much about me
and it was quite as important to me that I should
know them. The next evening, before going down to
dinner, I wrote my answer. “Yes,” I replied to the
encouraging query, “provided it is something a gentleman
can do, and I am well paid for it. But I will
conduct no negotiations in this way. I must see the
people I am doing business with.”</p>

<p>After dinner I retired to the same out-of-the-way
corner of the garden in which I had been found the
night before, on the side farthest away from the hotel
and the music, to await developments. It probably
was not long, but it seemed hours, before the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
three women came up the short flight of steps running
down to the street. The one who was doing
duty as a letter carrier, and who bore the imaginative
name of Ialla, was the last to appear. On reaching
the level of the garden her eyes roamed quickly
around until they turned toward where I was sitting.
Seeing me, she drew her veil across her face, as
though she resented being classed with the unregenerate
fellahin, and wished to show more discrimination
in her love affairs than they could boast, and
accompanied her companions in their ostensible
bargaining tour among the guests. To one who paid
them even casual attention they must have appeared
as timid traders, so lacking were they in the customary
insistence, and it was with small profits and
no great loss of time that they found their way
around to me. As on the night before, it was left to
Ialla to barter with me. I again took both of her
hands in mine, to examine her jewelry, of which she
wore a wealth that, like her looks, belied her dress,
and as I did so I slipped into one of them the tightly
folded note which I had been gripping for an hour or
more. Her jewels were much richer than those she
had worn the previous evening and as I studied their
barbaric beauty I softly pressed her childish hands,
as the only means of conveying something of the impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
she had made on me, for I did not know the
extent to which the other women were in our secret
or could be trusted. Her only response was one
quick glance, which I interpreted as a mixture of
pleasure, surprise, and interrogation; the one distinctly
pleasant thing about it was that it contained
nothing of indignation or hostility. Save for that
electric flash her wonderful eyes looked modestly
downward and her whole attitude was one of perfect
propriety, which more than ever convinced me that
she was not what she pretended to be. Finally she
drew her hands away, hurriedly but gently, and with
an impatient gesture, as though she had made up
her mind that I had no idea of making a purchase,
led her companions out of the garden.</p>

<p>There was no sign of either Ialla or her two friends
the next evening, though I watched for them closely.
On the second afternoon I received a call from my
old friend, who undoubtedly had recommended me
and vouched for me to the people who had opened
up the exceedingly interesting correspondence. It
was apparently a casual visit but its purpose was revealed
when, in the course of a general conversation
regarding the country and its ways, along which he
had cleverly piloted me, he said: “These Egyptians
are a remarkable people. I have lived among them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
long enough to know them and to admire, particularly,
their sublime religious faith and their exalted
sense of honor. With their enemies, and with the
travellers on whom they prey, they are tricky and
evasive to the last degree, but in their dealings with
people whom they know and trust they are the most
honorable men in the world. I don’t know whether
you expect to have any dealings with them, but if
you do, you can trust them absolutely.”</p>

<p>With that opening I was on the point of speaking
to him about the note I had received and answered,
but before I could say a word he had started off on
another subject, leaving me to understand that he
knew all about the matter but did not wish to talk of
it, and that he had taken that method, learned from
the diplomats, of endorsing the people with whom
he had put me in communication. We gossiped on
for some time, but though each knew what was uppermost
in the other’s mind neither of us spoke of it,
nor was the subject even indirectly referred to again.</p>

<p>This conversation indicated that the veiled proceedings
were nearing the point of a personal interview
with some one who knew something about the
scheme, and when I took my seat in the garden
that evening I was impatient for further unfoldings.
Not knowing what might happen, and despite the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
afternoon’s guarantee of good faith from a man I
had every reason to trust, I took the precaution to
arm myself with two Tranter revolvers. I had not
been waiting long when Ialla and her two companions
appeared and came straight toward me, but without
any sign of recognition. As she passed close beside
me, walking slowly, Ialla whispered, almost in my
ear: “Follow me at ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>It was then about nine-thirty. The inharmonious
trio moved on into the throng of guests and, as the
time passed, gradually worked their way around
toward the stairway leading down to the street. A
few minutes before ten I descended into the street to
wait for them, so it could not be seen from the hotel
that I was following them. Promptly on the hour
Ialla and her attendants came down the steps and
set off toward Old Cairo, which, however much it
may have been spoiled since, was then just the same
as when Haroun-al-Raschid used to take his midnight
rambles. At the corner of the hotel two men dressed
as servants stepped out of a shadow and fell in close
behind them, apparently to prevent me from engaging
them in conversation, which, but for this
barrier, I assuredly would have done. With all
amorous advances thus discouraged I remained far
enough behind so that it would not appear that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
was one of the party. They led me almost the full
length of the Mooshka, the main street of the old
town and the only one wide enough to permit the
passing of two carriages; turned into one of the narrow
side streets, then into another and another until
they stopped at last in front of a door at the side of
one of the little shops. When I was within perhaps
fifty feet of them Ialla entered the door, after looking
back at me, while her four companions walked rapidly
on down the street. I pushed open the door, which
was immediately closed by a servant who dropped a
bar across it, and found Ialla waiting for me in a
dimly lighted hallway. She led me nearly to the
end of the long hall, opened a door and motioned to
me to enter and closed the door from the outside.
I found myself in a large room, which, after my eyes
had become accustomed to the half light, I saw was
magnificently furnished. A fine-looking old Arab,
with gray hair and beard, was seated on an ottoman,
smoking a bubble pipe. His bearing was majestic
and for the purpose of easy identification he will be
known here as Regal, though that was not his name.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Pasha Boynton,” was his
greeting, in a deep, strong voice. He proved himself
a man of action, and advanced himself greatly in my
esteem by giving no time to idle chatter. “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
know you well,” he said, “through trustworthy information,
as a soldier and a sailor, and we believe
you are peculiarly well equipped for the work we
wish you to undertake. It is a sea-going expedition,
involving danger of disaster on one hand and the
cause of liberty and a substantial reward on the
other. Are you willing to attempt it?”</p>

<p>“If you are open to reasonable terms and I am
given full command of the expedition, I will gladly
undertake it,” I replied. “If it furnishes real adventure
I will be quite willing to accept that in part
payment for my services.”</p>

<p>“Then we should be able to agree without difficulty,”
he answered with a grim smile. “But,” he
added, as his keen face took on a stern expression and
his eyes looked through mine into my brain, “whether
or not we do reach an agreement, we can rely on you
to keep our secret and to drop no hint or word
through which it might be revealed?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” I replied, and my gaze was as steady
as his. He studied me intently for a full minute and
then said decisively, in the Arabic fashion: “It is
good.”</p>

<p>Without further ceremony he let me into the whole
plot. At the bottom of it was the old cry of “Egypt
for the Egyptians,” which is not yet dead and probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
will not die for centuries, if ever. It was Arabi
Pasha who made the last desperate fight under this
slogan and it was his release from exile that was
sought by the plotters, in order that he might renew
the war for native liberty. As a military genius
Arabi ranked almost with the great Ibrahim Pasha,
who died a few years after Arabi was born, and he
was fanatical in his love of country. From a Colonel
in the army he became Under Secretary of War and
then Minister of War, in which position he was practically
the Dictator of Egypt. With the aid of a
secret society which he organized among the native
officers of the army, and the carefully concealed support
of the Sultan, who had protested vainly against
the assumption of authority by the British and
French over this part of Turkish territory, he planned
and executed a revolt through which it was hoped to
restore native control of Egypt. The French, more
sentimental than selfish, and reluctant to take extreme
measures, withdrew at the last moment, leaving
it to the British to prosecute the war, which they
did with characteristic vigor. The bombardment of
Alexandria, on July 11 and 12, 1882, and the rout of
his army at Tel-el-Kebir two months later, dissipated
Arabi’s dream and, so far as surface indications were
concerned, established British rule in Egypt, exclusively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
and permanently. The movement which
Arabi had fostered apparently collapsed with that
battle, and he was exiled to Ceylon for life.</p>

<p>Briefly and bitterly this bit of history was reviewed
by the old Arab. Then he became more animated.
He said the loyal Egyptians had been planning a
new movement against the British, with great secrecy,
for a long time, and that the natives and a
large part of the army were ready to rise in revolt
whenever the signal was given. The butchery of the
gallant “Chinese” Gordon at Khartoum—a stain
on England’s fame which never can be blotted out—had
checked the British advance in the Soudan and to
some extent paralyzed the officials who, from the
safe haven of the War Office in London, were drawing
up plans of conquest, and the conspirators believed
the time had come for what they were confident
would prove a successful and final blow for
freedom. But, to make this ardently desired result
more certain, they needed the inspiring leadership of
Arabi Pasha, in whose talent for conflict they still
had great faith, which doubtless was intensified by
his enforced absence. Furthermore, Regal explained,
the superstitious natives would hail his unexpected
return from exile as a sign that they could not be
defeated and would fight more desperately and determinedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
than before. Through spies it had been
learned that Arabi was confined at a point near the
coast, only a short distance from Colombo, the capital
of Ceylon. He was allowed considerable freedom,
within certain prescribed limits, and was in the custody
of only a small guard. His escape was regarded
as impossible and the idea that an attempt might be
made to rescue him seemingly had not entered the
minds of those responsible for his safe-keeping.</p>

<p>Yet that was precisely what I was asked to accomplish.
After Regal had stated the conditions of
Arabi’s captivity he dramatically declared, with flashing
eyes: “The fires which the British foolishly
thought they had stamped out, were not, and could
never be, extinguished. They have been smouldering
ever since and are now ready to burst into a flame
that will consume everything before it. We need
only the presence of the great Arabi. You can bring
him to us. With a ship, whose true mission is concealed
by methods of which we know you to be a
master, you can sail to a point close to his place of
confinement. As soon as it is dark and quiet forty
or fifty of our brave men, who will accompany you,
will be landed. They will steal upon his guards and
silence them and return with the General to your
ship. There will be none left to give the alarm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
by the time it is discovered that he has been snatched
away from their cursed hands you will be far out of
sight, and with your knowledge of the ways of those
who sail the sea it should not be difficult for you to
avoid capture. You will land Arabi at some point to
be decided on, from which he can make his way to
Cairo. With his coming our banners will be unfurled
and Egypt will be restored to the Egyptians. It is a
mission in the cause of freedom and humanity. Are
you willing to undertake it?”</p>

<p>Long before he reached it, I saw his objective point,
and ran the whole scheme over in my mind while he
was laying down its principles. It did not strike me
as being at all foolhardy. As I have said before, it
is the so-called impossibilities which, when they are
not really impossible, as few of them are, can be most
easily accomplished, for the reason that they are not
guarded against. Under the conditions described,
the rescue of Arabi would be comparatively a simple
matter. The chief danger would come from the
British warships which would swarm the seas as
soon as his disappearance was discovered, for it
would be a natural conclusion that he was on some
vessel on his way back to Egypt. This danger
appealed to me, for it augured well for adventure.
It would be a game of hide-and-seek, such as I intensely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
enjoyed, with my wits pitted against those of
the British Navy, and with my varied experiences in
deep-sea deception, I did not consider that the odds
against me would be overwhelming. Therefore I
promptly assured the old patriot, whose anxiety and
excitement were shown in his blazing eyes, that I
would cheerfully assume responsibility for Arabi’s
rescue and his safe delivery at almost any point that
might be designated.</p>

<p>“It is good,” he replied, slowly and impressively.
“Egypt will be free.”</p>

<p>Profoundly wishing that the noble little “Leckwith”
was at my service instead of at the bottom of
the sea, I added that I had no ship and it would be
necessary to purchase one, as it would be impracticable
to charter a vessel for such a purpose. This
meant that the expedition would require some financing,
in addition to the charge for my services. With
a gesture which indicated that everything was settled
in his mind and that it was only necessary for me
to name my terms to have them agreed to, Regal said
he anticipated no difficulty on that point and suggested
that I return the next afternoon or evening to
meet his associates, who comprised the inner circle of
the revolutionary party. I told him I would be glad to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
come at any hour but I doubted that I could find my
way through the labyrinth of narrow streets.</p>

<p>“How has the person who guided you here conducted
herself?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Irreproachably.”</p>

<p>“She will signal you to-morrow afternoon or evening.
Follow her.”</p>

<p>With that he arose, terminating the interview; we
solemnly shook hands and he escorted me to the
door. I was wondering how I should find the way
back to my hotel when I descried Ialla and her four
shadows waiting for me a short distance down the
street. Without a word they showed me the course
until I made out the hotel, when they disappeared
down a side street.</p>

<p>I was lounging in the garden early the next afternoon,
for there was no telling when the summons
might come and I would take no chance of missing it.
It was about four o’clock, at which hour all Cairo
was on parade and the crowd was thickest around the
hotel, that Ialla and her faithful female guards entered
the lively scene. Her face was almost entirely
hidden by her veil but there was no mistaking her
eyes. They caught mine and a quick little beckoning
motion, which no one else would have noticed, told
me to follow her. She soon left, walking slowly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
I took up the trail, restraining myself with an effort
from approaching her more closely than wisdom dictated.
Avoiding the crowded Mooshka they led me,
by a more circuitous route, back to the house where
I had been so agreeably entertained the night before,
and which was entered in the same way. Regal was
waiting for me and with him were five of his countrymen,
to whom I was introduced <i>en bloc</i>. They were
dignified and reserved but sharp-eyed and vigorous
and they looked like fighters of the first water.
They were much younger than Regal and evidently,
from the deference shown him, he was the chief
conspirator.</p>

<p>“These,” he said, with a courtly wave of his hand
toward the others, “are the relatives and companions-in-arms
of Arabi Pasha and the men who, with me,
are directing our operations. They are perfectly
responsible, as you will see, and in every way entitled
to your confidence, as you are worthy of theirs.”</p>

<p>With this formal assurance we sat down to a detailed
discussion of the project. They told me of their
plans, as Regal had previously explained them in a
general way, and professed confidence that with
Arabi in personal command of their forces, and with
the active coöperation of the Soudanese, which was
assured, they would drive the hated British out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
Egypt, and keep them out. Their knowledge of the
surroundings at Arabi’s place of confinement and
their plan for overpowering his guards and securing
his release, which was complete to the slaughter of
the last man, showed an intimate acquaintance with
conditions that surprised me. From all they told
me on this point I gained the idea that they were
working in harmony with their brother Mohammedans
in India, and that the latter were planning a
similar uprising when the conditions were judged
to be opportune. Developments since then have
strengthened this belief into a conviction. It is never
wise to predict, but when England some day becomes
involved in a war with a first-class power, like Germany
for instance, which will tax her fighting forces
to the limit, there need be no surprise if the natives
of Egypt and India rise simultaneously and become
their own masters.</p>

<p>It was urged by them and agreed that I should
take no part in the actual rescue of Arabi but remain
on the ship, to guard against any surprise by water
and to be ready to steam westward as soon as the
party returned. I was to stand in close to the shore
just after dark, with all lights doused, and it was
thought that Arabi would be safe on board long
enough before sunrise so that we could be well clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
of the land by daylight. The point at which Arabi
was to be landed caused considerable discussion. As
the British were certain to promptly patrol the Red
Sea, with all of the warships that could be hurried
into it, and closely guard the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb,
it was tentatively decided that the safest and
wisest course would be to put him ashore near Jibuti,
on friendly French soil, from which point he could
pick a pathway through Abyssinia and down the
Nile, with little danger of detection and with the
advantage of being able to arouse the enthusiasm of
the Soudanese and other tribes through which he
passed. I was in favor of running the gantlet of the
Strait and landing him two or three hundred miles
south of the Gulf of Suez, which would expedite the
revolt and also make things more exciting, but
the others feared this would expose him too much to
the danger of recapture. They were for the surest way
and said that more reckless methods could wait until
he was at the head of his troops. This conclusion
as to the landing place, however, was not final. It
was understood that I would receive definite instructions
when I put in at Saukin, on the way out, to take
on the fifty proud and trusted warriors who were to
effect the release of their revered leader.</p>

<p>The fact that consideration of terms was the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
question brought up was a delicate compliment to my
supposed fairness which I appreciated. Instead of
asking them for fifty thousand pounds, as I had intended
to, I stipulated only forty thousand, one-half
of which was to be advanced to me for the purchase
of a suitable ship. The ship was, of course, to be
turned over to them at the conclusion of the expedition.
I was to pay all expenses and collect the
remaining twenty thousand pounds after Arabi had
been landed. If they had fixed the terms themselves
they could not have agreed to them more readily, and
I was asked to return at ten o’clock the next evening
for the initial payment.</p>

<p>Our negotiations thus rapidly concluded, I was invited
to remain to dinner, which is the crowning
honor of Egyptian confidence and hospitality. I
needed no urging and never have I enjoyed a meal
more. The table-talk was general, but running all
through it was the love of freedom and the plan
through which they hoped to realize their passion.
Their interest in American affairs was only that
called for by courtesy, but they made me tell many
stories of our wars with England, from which they
derived much satisfaction.</p>

<p>“We are as much entitled to our freedom as you
are,” declared one of my hosts, whose green turban<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
indicated that he could trace his ancestry back to
Mahomet, “and we will win ours in the end, just as
your people won theirs. We may be a strange
people,” he added, reflectively, “but we are not so
bad as we have been painted. The <i>howadji</i> [strangers]
condemn our religion without understanding it
and preach to us another, which, so far as we can
observe from its practices, falls far short of our own.
Mohammedanism needs no defence from me, but I
will tell you just one thing about it. If you were
now to murder my brother I could not lay hands
on you or harm you, for you have eaten of my salt,
but not even Mahomet could make me cease to hate
you in my heart. Does the Christian religion, of
which the British are so proud, teach you that?”</p>

<p>I confessed that it didn’t, so far as I had information
or belief, and made my sincere salaams to his
faith. If I am ever to become afflicted with any
religious beliefs, I hope they will be those taught by
Mahomet.</p>

<p>When I finally started back to my hotel Ialla and
her attendants were waiting for me in the alley, for
it was not wide enough to be called a street. They
started on ahead, but we had gone only a few short
blocks when her four companions walked briskly
away and she waited for me, in a shadow so deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
that I at first thought she had entered one of the
queer houses and my spirits fell, to be revivified a
moment later when I almost ran into her.</p>

<p>“How did your business turn out?” she inquired
anxiously, as I bowed low before her. Her voice,
which I had been longing to hear, was soft and clear,
as well became her, and her radiant beauty shone
forth through the darkness.</p>

<p>“Thanks to your cleverness,” I replied, “it has
turned out well.”</p>

<p>“Then you are going to rescue my uncle,” she
exclaimed delightedly. Her sparkling eyes flamed
with excitement and, as if to seal the compact, she
extended her hand, which I first pressed and then
kissed. Then I slipped it through my arm and
started to walk out of the shadow into the moonlight,
and she accompanied me without protest.</p>

<p>She had exchanged her cotton robe for one of silk,
which was much more fitting, and as I looked down
on her I thought her the most beautiful woman
I had ever seen. If I had held the same opinion as
to others of her sex I was not reminded of it then,
and there was no manner of doubt that I was deeply
in love with her. We walked long and talked much,
and some of it was interesting. She told me, though
it did not need the telling, that she was a lady and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
that she had risked her reputation and exposed herself
to coarsest insult by appearing in public unveiled
and dressed as a servant, out of love for her uncle
and devotion to his cause. To prevent suspicion it
had been determined that communication should be
opened with me through a woman, and she had volunteered
for the service. She said she had seen me at
the Khedive’s reception, which she had witnessed
through the fretwork from the apartments of the
Khedivah—from which it appeared that I had been
under consideration by the revolutionary leaders for
several weeks before I was approached—and so she
knew the man to whom the introductory note was to
be delivered. The two women servants, who could
not be trusted with such confidential correspondence,
accompanied her for the double purpose of protecting
her as much as possible and carrying out the
peddling pretence. This explained why she had kept
in the background and covered her face with her
scraggly veil most of the time. On her first visit, she
said, she had fully exposed her face so that I might
see she was not of the class of her companions and
be the more willing to hold commercial converse with
her; in her heart she knew her beauty would attract
me, wherein she displayed an abundantly justifiable
confidence in her charms, but she expressed it without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
the words or style of vanity. Except for that
brief period when she was altogether unveiled she
said she really did not have great fear of being discovered,
for it was unlikely that any of her friends
would be around the hotel at the hours when she
went there, and, even if they did see her, it was improbable
that they would recognize her in fellahin
attire. As a matter of fact, she confessed, as we
became better acquainted, she had entered into the
plot not only through love for her distinguished
uncle, to whom she was devoted, but from a liking
for doing things that were out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>It was this same spirit which induced her, on the
night of my first opportunity to tell her of her beauty
and my fervid love for her, to bribe her servants to
disappear for a time. By the light of the Egyptian
moon, which would inspire even a lout of a lover, I
told her, in words that burned, of the passion she had
implanted within me by the first glance of her wonderful
eyes, and I was encouraged by the fact that
she seemed more sympathetic than otherwise. We
walked for hours through deserted streets that were
far from lonely until at last we came to a corner near
the hotel where her attendants were waiting for her,
patiently, I presumed, from their natures, but whether
patiently or not was of no concern to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>The next night I found my way alone to Regal’s
abode and received the first payment of twenty
thousand pounds, in Paris exchange. There was a
final conference, at which all of the details were gone
over again as a precaution against any misunderstanding,
and I took my departure with many good
wishes. Ialla and her two women attendants were
waiting for me, as had been arranged, and my love-making
was resumed where I had left off on the preceding
night. Ialla was more responsive than before,
but when I urged her to go with me to France or
marry me at once in Cairo she would not listen.
Finally she said: “After you have rescued my uncle
I will go with you anywhere, but not until then will
I think of marriage.”</p>

<p>Nothing could move her from that decision. I
arranged to meet her the next night and the one following,
and several others, which she accomplished
by the popular method of bribing her attendants, but,
though it was a joy to her to be told of my love there
was no way by which she could be induced to yield
to it until her uncle was free. Finally she regretfully
insisted that I must leave, for her relatives, she said,
were becoming seriously disturbed over the fact that
I had remained so long in Cairo, instead of going
about the important business at hand. In my infatuation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
I had forgotten discretion and my promise
to conduct the expedition with all possible speed.
Even when this was brought home to me it required
all of my will power to say <i>au revoir</i> to the beauteous
Ialla, though I expected to see her soon again and
hold her to her promise.</p>

<p>I went to Marseilles and called on a <i>huissier
d’marine</i>, or ship broker, named Oliviera, to whom
I had been recommended. After looking over several
ships that were for sale I bought “L’Hirondelle”
(The Swallow), a coasting steamer of eight hundred
tons that had been running between Marseilles and
Citta Vecchia, the port of Rome. She was old but in
good condition and could do seventeen knots or better.
I took command of the ship and my first and
second officers were Leigh and Wilson, who came
down from London in response to a telegram, bringing
with them half a dozen men whom I knew could
be trusted. The crew was filled out with Frenchmen
and we headed for Suakin, far down on the Egyptian
side of the Red Sea. There I was to receive final
instructions and pick up the Arabs who were to do
the manual labor, and whatever assassination was
necessary, in connection with Arabi’s restoration to
his countrymen. As soon as we were in the Red Sea
I stripped off the ship’s French name, rechristened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
her the “Adventure,” hoisted the British flag over
her, and gave her a forged set of papers in keeping
with her name and nationality.</p>

<p>At Suakin one of the great surprises of my life
awaited me. We had scarcely tied up when the man
from whom I was to receive the warriors came aboard
with a letter from Regal directing me to turn the
ship over to him and discharge the crew. The agent
could not understand the change of plan any more
than I could, and I could not even guess as to the
cause, but he was there to obey orders and there was
nothing else for me to do. I could not make any kind
of a formal protest without revealing something concerning
my mission, which I would not do, and, besides
that, the ship did not belong to me. Feeling
sure there would be a satisfactory explanation waiting
for me at Cairo I returned there, after paying off
the crew and sending them back to Marseilles and
London in charge of Leigh and Wilson.</p>

<p>I was still more mystified when, on reaching Cairo,
I was unable to find Regal, Ialla, or any one else connected
with the undertaking, nor could I get the
slightest trace of them. I located the house in which
I had been so charmingly admitted into the conspiracy,
but the people living there were strangers,
so far as I was permitted to observe or could ascertain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
and they insisted they knew nothing at all
concerning the previous occupants. If I could have
searched the house I might have found out differently,
but that was out of the question. Here was
Egyptian mystery beyond what I had bargained for.
It was as though I had been roughly awakened from
a delightfully realistic dream. The only theory on
which I could explain the puzzle was that the government
had in some way learned of the plot, in consequence
of which every one identified with it had
disappeared, leaving it to me to take the hint and do
likewise. In the hope of seeing Ialla again and determined
to secure some definite clue as to just what had
happened in my absence, I waited around for two
weeks or more, until I encountered the old friend
who, I knew, was responsible for my connection with
the conspiracy. I did not dissemble, as I had before,
but took him to my room, told him the riddle, and
asked him the answer. I did not expect him to admit
anything and was not disappointed. What he said,
in substance, was this: “Of course I know nothing
about the plot of which you have told me. If what
you say is true I should say that you have been making
something of a fool of yourself over this Ialla
and that you have only yourself to blame for the
abrupt ending which seems to have been reached.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
You are very shrewd and far-sighted and I will admit
that ordinarily you are not much moved by sentiment,
but this black-eyed beauty seems to have
carried you off your feet. These women are the
greatest flirts in the world. There is nothing they
enjoy so much as clandestine meetings at which they
can listen to passionate protestations of love, and
when these come from a foreigner their cup of happiness
is full. You thought Ialla was in love with you,
but she was only having a good time with you, and
she has taken a lot of pride in telling her friends about
your meetings at their afternoon gatherings in the
old cemetery for the exchange of gossip. She had
no idea of marrying you, an unbeliever, you may be
sure of that. It may be that she thought she was
stimulating you to deeds of heroism in the rescue of
her uncle, but, if she considered that at all, it was a
secondary matter. The men you were dealing with
have the contempt of their race for all women. They
cannot understand how any man can become so
enamoured of a woman, no matter how beautiful, as
to let it interfere with his business. When a man
who, for the time being, has the leading role in a
prospective revolution, so far forgets himself as to
waste a week of valuable time in running after a
flirtatious female they are quite likely to conclude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
that he is too foolish and reckless to be trusted with
such an important matter. They would argue that
no man who could be relied on to carry out their
plan would display such lack of judgment. It is possible
that there may be some other reason for the
situation in which you find yourself, but I doubt it.
The wisest course for you is to tell me how you can
be reached, and leave Cairo, for you can gain nothing
by staying here. It is known to many persons that I
know you and if any one should want to get in communication
with you, I will be able to tell him how to
do it.”</p>

<p>Possessing all the pride of a full-blooded man, I
resented the calm assertion that I had been ensnared
by a flirt, and a somewhat acrimonious argument followed,
but, in looking back at it now, I am willing
to admit that probably my friend was right about it.
Perhaps Ialla was not, after all, the perfect woman
that, under the magic spell of her marvellous beauty,
I imagined her to be, and possibly if I had not surrendered
so suddenly to her charms Arabi Pasha
might have been freed and Egypt might now be an
Empire. Whether or not that is true, I have no
regrets on the subject, except that I never saw Ialla
again. My moonlight meetings with her were, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
least, a diversion, and they gave me great enjoyment
while they lasted.</p>

<p>Though it went against the grain I was compelled
to admit that my friend’s advice was the best I could
get, and I reluctantly followed it. Feeling that for
once my destiny had played it a bit low down on me
I crossed the Mediterranean and took a French liner
for New York. I had spent four months and much
money in studying the Sphinx, but I did not count
them as lost. Ialla’s loveliness was in my mind for
a long time and while it remained I cherished the
hope that I would be recalled to carry out the plan
for the rescue of her uncle, but the summons never
came. Eleven years later Arabi was pardoned and
returned to Egypt, but his influence among his own
people was gone; the fact that he had accepted a
pardon implied, to their astute minds, a secret agreement
with their enemies and caused him to be regarded
as a tool of the British. But, as very recent
events have demonstrated, the fires of freedom are
still burning, and now and again signal smoke is
seen rising over India.</p>

<small>RAPID-FIRE REVOLTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE friendliness of Fate, in throwing me in the
way of adventures which were beyond my discernment,
was never more plainly evidenced than on
my return to New York from Australia and Egypt
in 1890. On the trip across the Atlantic my mind
had wandered away from the West Indies and I experienced
an increasing desire to return to South
America, but one of the first things I heard on my
arrival was that my old friend Guzman Blanco had
finally been shorn of his supreme power in Venezuela
only a few months before. He had been betrayed
by his friends, after the established fashion of that
captivating country, and Dr. Anduesa Palacio, one
of his enemies of years, had been made President with
the approval and assistance of Dr. Rojas Paul, the
dummy whom Guzman had left as titular head of the
government while he was revelling in Paris, his foreign
capital. This discouraged me for a time in my
half-formed plan to return to my Southern stamping
ground, and as I had plenty of money and was not
averse to a rest, I concluded to wait around, Micawber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
like, for something to turn up. But it was not
long until a silent voice began calling me to South
America; softly, at first, and then so loudly that it
came as a command. I had heard the same sort of
an order before, and only very recently, and was not
disposed to disregard it. I felt sure it would not lead
me into disappointment twice in succession.</p>

<p>Without knowing where or how the cruise would
end, but confident it would lead to trouble—though
I did not imagine how much of it there really would
be or how unpleasant it would prove—I bought the
“Alice Ada,” a brigantine of three hundred tons, laid
her on with Thos. Norton &amp; Sons, and got a general
cargo for Rosario, Brazil, on the River Parava.
From Rosario I went one hundred miles up the river
to St. Stephens and took on a cargo of wheat for Rio
Janiero. As soon as I had looked around a little in
Rio, while the cargo was being unloaded, I understood
why I had gone there, for my expectant eye
distinguished signs of a nice little revolution which
was just being shaped up. These indications, though
somewhat vague to even an experienced new arrival,
were so encouraging in their promise of exciting
events that I sold my ship and took quarters at the
Hotel Freitas to watch developments. I had not long
to wait before the young republic celebrated its first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
revolution, but it was accomplished in such a disgracefully
quiet way, and in such marked contrast
with that sort of proceeding in Venezuela, and in
Central America and the West Indies, that I was
thoroughly disgusted with the country and was
tempted to move on again into new fields. A land in
which the government is changed by the force of
public sentiment alone, and without the booming of
cannon and the bursting of bombs, has no charm for
me.</p>

<p>When the last Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II,
was dragged out of bed at night and deported without
the firing of a shot, in the “Peaceful Revolution”
of November 15, 1889, Deodoro da Fonseca was
made President by the lovers of liberty and equality,
which purely imaginary conditions of life never will
be found in any country. Before his weakness had
become apparent he was made Constitutional President
and Floriano Peixotto was elected Vice-President.
Deodoro had neither the firmness nor the
initiative that the situation demanded. His policy
was weak and vacillating and his popularity waned
rapidly. The revolution which was in the process
of formation when I arrived on the scene was, I discovered,
being quietly fomented by Floriano, the
Vice-President. He soon had the army at his back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
and, as the people were beginning to clamor for him,
it was an easy matter to gain the support of Admiral
Mello, the ranking officer of the Brazilian Navy, and
Admiral Soldanha da Gama, commandant of the naval
academy. They brought matters to a head on the
morning of November 23, 1891. Mello took up a
position at the foot of the main street of Rio in the
cruiser “Riachuelo,” the finest ship in the navy,
trained his guns on the palace of Itumary, and sent
word to Deodoro that he would open fire on him in
two hours if he did not abdicate in favor of Floriano.
Deodoro abdicated in two minutes, and dropped dead
soon afterward from heart disease, and Floriano was
proclaimed President.</p>

<p>Before he had time to get his new chair well
warmed he had a row with Mello, and as soon as I
heard of it I foresaw another revolution, which pleasing
prospect prompted me to remain in Brazil, for
I did not believe it could possibly prove as uninteresting
as those that had preceded it. Mello regarded
himself as the President-maker and considered that
he was rightfully entitled to be the power behind
the throne. However, Floriano was not at all constituted
for the role of a mere figurehead and he made
it plain to Mello that while he might make courteous
suggestions and even give friendly advice, he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
not go an inch beyond that. Floriano was really a
remarkable man. He was perhaps one-half Indian
and the rest corrupted Portuguese; sixty years old,
with clear, brown eyes and iron gray hair and whiskers.
A strong, fine character he was; perfectly fearless,
absolutely honest and devoted to his country,
whose interests he greatly advanced. He was proud
of his Indian blood, which he made a synonyme for
courage and fairness, and often referred to it. He
was the best President I have ever known, not excepting
even the great Guzman.</p>

<p>Mello was a younger man and more of a Spaniard
in his blood and his characteristics. He had considerable
bravery, of the kind that is best displayed
in the presence of a large audience, but he was impetuous
and at times foolish. He was abnormally
ambitious and believed in a rule or ruin policy. At
that, he was more a man after my own heart, for he
stood for revolt and anarchy, while Floriano stood for
law and order. Soldanha da Gama, the third figure in
the drama, was a strange mixture of naval ability,
cowardice, and theatrical bravery.</p>

<p>When Floriano refused to be dictated to or even
influenced in his views as to what was best for Brazil,
Mello proceeded to plot against him with even more
earnestness than he had displayed in the plans to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
overthrow Deodoro. He worked chiefly among the
naval officers, the aristocrats, the adherents of Dom
Pedro, and the Catholic clergy, and in the end they all
became his allies. He was unable to shake the army,
though he tried repeatedly to create dissatisfaction
among the troops, and the influence of the priests
was minimized by the fact that the people generally
were blindly in love with the new scheme of
self-government, which sounded well and appealed
strongly to their sentimental natures, and were loyal
to Floriano.</p>

<p>As Mello’s plot shaped up I began to suspect that
his real purpose was to restore Dom Pedro to the
throne and make himself the power behind it. Mello
cared nothing for titles; it was his ambition to be
the dictator of Brazil, with power as absolute as that
which Guzman Blanco had exercised for many years
in Venezuela. It was natural for him to suppose that
if he reëstablished the Empire under its old ruler,
Dom Pedro would be so grateful to him, and to him
alone, that he would be thoroughly subservient to his
influence. Later events confirmed me not only in the
belief that this was what was in Mello’s mind, but
that he had an understanding with Dom Pedro and,
through him, with several European rulers, who were
keenly anxious to see the “divine right of kings”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
perpetuated in South America. Mello considered
that the dictator to an Emperor would have more
power than the dictator to a President, and he may
have even dreamed that he would some day take the
throne himself and establish a new dynasty. Dom
Pedro had issued a protest against his deposition as
soon as he reached Europe, in which all the princes
of Coburg joined, and was conducting an active campaign
for his restoration. It is interesting to note,
in passing, that there is still a pretender to the throne
of Brazil. When Dom Pedro died he left his lost
crown to Donna Isabella, wife of Count D’Eu, a
Bourbon prince. She passed it over to her eldest son,
Peter, when he became of age, and only recently he
transferred all of his shadowy rights and prerogatives
to his younger brother, Louis, who now considers
himself the rightful ruler of Brazil. The Old
World has a way of keeping up pretenderships that
is almost as ridiculous as some of the revolutions of
the New World.</p>

<p>It was amusing to watch the development of
Mello’s rebellion, which continued through all of
1892 and the greater part of the following year. One
would have thought that two friendly leaders were
planning rival surprise parties, in which there was
to be nothing more serious than the throwing of confetti.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
Floriano, surrounded by spies and assassins
but also by many loyal and devoted friends, knew perfectly
well, from his own spies, what Mello was
doing, but, relying on his own strength and the public
sentiment behind him, he made no move to check
him. On the other hand, Mello was well aware that
Floriano knew all that was going on, yet neither one
gave any outward sign of this knowledge, and when
they were together they appeared to be friends.</p>

<p>It was along in July or August, 1893, that I was
delightedly dragged into the mysterious muss, after
a period of waiting that was long, anxious, and expensive.
Mello sent for me first and expressed a
wish that I go down to Santa Catharina Island, off the
southern coast of Brazil, and blow up the “Republica,”
the one Brazilian warship whose officers had
remained loyal to Floriano, though finally, just before
the revolution was declared, they went over to Mello.
With the exception of Soldanha da Gama, who was
neutral but whom he regarded as more of a friend
than an enemy, Mello had converted the rest of the
navy to his cause, but the “Republica” held out
against him and he wanted her put out of the way
of doing him harm. He offered a cash payment and a
commission in the navy in return for her destruction,
but I could never get him down to definite terms or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
to a contract that I would accept. We had several
conferences, and, while we were still negotiating, I
received a call from one of Floriano’s aides, who
asked me to accompany him to the palace. He took
me in the rear entrance and up a back stairway to
Floriano’s private <i>sala</i> where, after presenting me,
he left me, as I supposed, alone with the President.</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Floriano, getting right down
to business, “that you were in Venezuela with President
Guzman and that you have had military training
and experience.”</p>

<p>“That is correct, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am told, too, that you have made a study of
high explosives and have invented a remarkable
torpedo.”</p>

<p>“That also is true.”</p>

<p>“Would you be willing to undertake a mission that
would involve considerable danger, but for which you
would be well paid?”</p>

<p>“I am open to anything except vulgar assassination.
That is my business.”</p>

<p>“What do you charge for your services?”</p>

<p>“That depends entirely on the nature of the work.”</p>

<p>“Then we can leave that question open until the
nature of the work has been decided on, provided it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
is understood that your compensation will be such as
you are ordinarily accustomed to.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p>“Brazil may need your services, Colonel Boynton,”
with an accent on the “Colonel.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” I interrupted, “Captain
Boynton.”</p>

<p>“I repeat, Colonel Boynton,” he replied, with a
smile and the suggestion of a bow. “Brazil may
need your services, but I cannot tell how soon nor
in what capacity.”</p>

<p>“If I enter your service it will be a loyal service
to the end,” I told him.</p>

<p>“Consider yourself then in the service of Brazil.”
As he said this he raised his hand and from behind
a curtain appeared Captain Cochrane, a descendant of
the English Admiral Cochrane who had fought for
Brazil seventy years before. He had heard all that
we had said.</p>

<p>“As we were strangers I took this precaution,” explained
Floriano. “It will not be necessary again.”</p>

<p>“It was a perfectly justifiable precaution,” I replied.</p>

<p>Captain Cochrane then repeated in English my conversation
with the President, to be sure I understood
it, after which I was escorted back to my hotel. Immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
on my arrival there I sent word to Mello
that our negotiations were off and that I would consider
no further proposition from him.</p>

<p>A few days after this meeting with the President
the revolution was declared, under conditions such
as one would look for on the light opera stage but
never in real life, not even in South America. On
the evening of September fifth, Floriano went to the
opera, accompanied by Mello, Soldanha and several
other officers of the army and navy, and they all sat
together in the presidential box. Mello and Soldanha
excused themselves after the second act. They left
their cloaks in the box and said they would be back
in a few minutes. Knowing full well the reason for
their departure and that they had no thought of returning,
Floriano bowed them out with an ironical
excess of politeness. Soldanha, who had not yet
taken sides, though his sympathies were with the
“rebellion” and he subsequently allied himself with
it, retired to the naval school, on an island near the
city, and Mello went on board his flagship, the
“Aquidaban.” During the night he assembled his
captains and impressively gave them their final
orders, with the dramatic announcement that the
standard of revolt would be hoisted at sunrise. His
fleet, in addition to the flagship, consisted of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
“Guanabara,” “Trajano,” and “Almirante Tamandate,”
protected cruisers; the “Sete de Setembro,” a
wooden barbette ship; the gunboat “Centaur,” and
two river monitors. The protected cruiser “Republica,”
whose officers had just decided to join the rest
of the navy in the effort to compel the retirement of
Floriano, was coming up from down the coast, and
the “Riachuelo,” with which Mello had forced the
abdication of Deodoro, was cruising in the Mediterranean.
It was not an imposing fighting force but
it was sufficient to give Mello command of the sea,
while Floriano was in control of the forts and the
land forces.</p>

<p>At daybreak Mello seized all of the government
shipping in the bay and announced a blockade of
Rio harbor. He then sent word to Floriano that if
he did not abdicate, without naming his successor,
by four o’clock that afternoon, the city would be bombarded.
This threat was also communicated to the
foreign ministers, evidently in the hope that they
would try to persuade Floriano to step out, in the
interests of peace, but they promptly protested to
Mello against bombardment. Under any circumstances,
they told him, unless he proposed to violate
the international rules of warfare, he could not bombard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
until after formal notice of forty-eight hours, to
allow the removal of neutrals and non-combatants.</p>

<p>Floriano’s reply was an emphatic refusal to abdicate,
and, precisely at four o’clock, Mello answered
it with one shell from a three-inch gun, which
exploded near the American consulate and killed a
foreigner. During the next week Mello fired forty
or fifty shots into the city every day but they did
little damage; the fact that they apparently were not
aimed at any particular spot probably made no difference
in the execution. Frequently he would send
boats ashore for supplies, to which nobody paid any
attention, and at four o’clock every afternoon the
“Aquidaban” would steam solemnly over and engage
in a comic opera duel with Fort Santa Cruz, which
was located at the point of the harbor entrance opposite
Sugar Loaf Hill. Mello’s shots invariably went
clear over the fort or buried themselves in its walls,
while the gunners at the fort could not have hit him
if he had stood still for an hour, so no damage was
done to either side. After about twenty shots the
“Aquidaban” would return to her anchorage, slowly
and with great dignity, and hostilities would be over
until the next day at the same hour. This daily duel,
which was the star act in the serio-comic programme,
always drew a crowd to the water front. Business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
went on as usual throughout the “revolution,” which
was regarded with amused interest rather than with
fear.</p>

<p>Very soon after the firing of the first shot, Italian,
English, German, Austrian, and Portuguese warships
appeared at Rio, ostensibly to protect the rights of
their citizens, but their prompt arrival, made possible
only by the fact that they were cruising close at
hand, which was in itself significant, and the attitude
they assumed, made it plain to me that they
were there under secret orders to aid in the restoration
of Dom Pedro. Mello was not a rebel but a
pirate, yet the commanders of these foreign ships,
all representing monarchies, gave him their moral
support, and I have always believed that only the
belated arrival of an American naval force prevented
them from giving him their active support as well.
Their influence was so strong that when Rear
Admiral Oscar F. Stanton, of the United States
Navy, finally reached Rio, he made the inexcusable
mistake of saluting Mello. For this he was speedily
recalled, Rear Admiral Gherardi being sent down to
succeed him. Stanton’s excuse was that he wished
to maintain a neutral position, but no question of
neutrality was involved. I know that several of the
American naval officers who arrived later shared my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
view that Mello was a pirate and should have been
blown out of the water by the combined fleets. It
was evident, from the prompt recall of Stanton, that
the Navy Department at Washington held the same
opinion but had not sufficient courage in its convictions
to order the suppression of Mello. The ranking
officer of the combined fleets was the Italian
Vice Admiral, Magnani. The senior British officer
present was Captain Lang, of the “Sirius.” Until
the arrival of an officer of flag rank Captain Henry
F. Picking, of the “Charleston,” was the senior officer
present of the American Navy, and next to him was
Captain (now Rear Admiral, retired) Silas W. Terry,
on the “Newark.”</p>

<p>About a week after the firing of the first shot I
was on my way to the water front to witness the
regular afternoon duel between the “Aquidaban”
and Fort Santa Cruz, when I was overtaken by a government
carriage, and Col. Pimental, whom I knew
well, asked me to get in with him as he had orders for
me from Floriano. He drove along the shore of the
bay to a new galvanized building, at a point some distance
beyond the island of the naval school and near
the railway machine shops. On the way he explained
that this building had been erected for my use and
in it I was to construct, as rapidly as possible, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
large torpedo with which to destroy the “Aquidaban.”
I was to have whatever I called for, but, from
the time work was begun on the torpedo until it was
finished, I was to allow no one to enter or leave the
building, for fear that word of what was being done
should get to Mello’s spies. The structure was of
ample size and had comfortable living accommodations
for ten men, which was as many as I could use.
I took up my quarters in the building at once and
after drawing on the master mechanic of the railroad
for a lot of copper plates and such other supplies
as I would need, got right to work.</p>

<p>Late that evening I heard the rumble of a carriage
outside and a moment later in walked Floriano,
with an old gray shawl around his shoulders,
the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of
Marine, and a Senator. Floriano inquired first as to
my comfort and I assured him that I was entirely
satisfied. Then he said: “I am relying on you, Colonel
Boynton, to save Brazil from further trouble by
destroying the ‘Aquidaban.’ You will have to make
and use your torpedo, with such help as we can give
you. Now that you know what you are to do, what
is your price?”</p>

<p>I told him I would expect to be paid the appraised
value of the ship if I sank her or put her out of commission.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
After consulting with the others Floriano
agreed to my terms; but to prevent future argument
we fixed the value of the ship at six hundred thousand
dollars gold and a contract along these lines was
drawn up and signed the next day.</p>

<p>The torpedo which I built for this business was
the largest I had ever made. It was twelve feet
long and four feet in diameter in the middle, and
carried more than five hundred pounds of dynamite,
for I wanted to be certain that the ship would be at
least disabled by her contact with it. I paid the most
careful attention to the mechanism and, to prevent
the possibility of a miss-fire, arranged a double
detonating apparatus which would explode the main
charge when either one of the projecting arms was
forced backward by pressing against the hull of the
ship. With the completion of the torpedo, which it
took us ten days to build, I tested it with five hundred
and fifty pounds of iron and found that I had calculated
the air chamber support to precisely the proper
point, for it floated just below the surface of the
water. Floriano came down to witness the final test,
after a few leaks, developed by the first one, had been
closed, and handed me a commission as Colonel in
the Brazilian Army. He approved the plan of campaign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
which I had mapped out and said the necessary
orders would be issued at once.</p>

<p>“I believe you will succeed,” were his parting
words. “I hope you will come back as General
Boynton.”</p>

<p>To the south of Rio Bay, which is the main harbor,
and within the city itself, lies the little Bay of Botafogo,
round like an apple and with a narrow entrance.
On the north side of the harbor and cut off from it
by a long, low peninsula which ends in a high promontory,
is Nictheroy Bay. This peninsula, which
is so low for a considerable distance back of its terminating
eminence that it is covered by water at high
tide, when it is crossed by a bridge, lies west of the
Fort of Santa Cruz. Mello’s fleet was anchored off
the peninsula, on the opposite side of the harbor from
the city. While Mello had seized all of the government
vessels in the harbor there were a few tugs left,
which, to prevent his interference, were flying the
British flag, on the pretence that they were owned by
Englishmen. I was to be given one of these tugs
and my plan was to steal around into Nictheroy
Bay at night and anchor close under the hill at the
end of the peninsula, where I would be hidden from
the rebel fleet. In the morning I would load the torpedo
and wait for the daily exchange of cannon courtesies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
between the “Aquidaban” and the fort. An
officer at Santa Cruz was to signal me when Mello
left his anchorage and then, towing the submerged
torpedo by a wire rope too small to be detected, I
would steam out from behind the sheltering promontory
and head for Botafogo Bay. This would carry
me directly across the course of the “Aquidaban,”
which would pick up the towing line on her bow,
drag the torpedo alongside of her, and, as I expected
and hoped, be destroyed by the explosion which
would ensue when one of its long arms came in contact
with her hull.</p>

<p>The line by which the torpedo was to be towed was
two thousand feet long and was supported at intervals
by little floats that were painted the color of
the water. This gave me room to keep well clear of
the “Aquidaban,” and I did not think Mello would
see anything suspicious in an insignificant little towboat,
under the British flag, running diagonally
across his bow at a distance of a quarter of a mile.
This was the only plan which gave promise of success,
for it was impossible for an unknown craft of
any kind to get close to the “Aquidaban” while
she was at anchor, and there never has been any
doubt in my mind that it would have worked perfectly
but for the fact that Mello had full knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
of our movements and our plans. Our operations had
been conducted with such extreme secrecy that we
had no suspicion that they were known to any one but
Floriano and his most trusted advisers but, as a
matter of fact, Mello’s spies in high places had kept
him constantly advised as to what we were doing and
when we intended to strike. To show his high
regard for the foreign fleet of royalty he reported us
to the British naval commander and we were captured
in humiliating fashion, while the “Aquidaban”
remained safely at her anchorage. Mello
expected that I would be turned over to him and that
he would have the satisfaction of ordering my execution,
but in that he was disappointed.</p>

<p>My tug, in charge of a French engineer and four
Brazilians, was sent down to me on the afternoon of
September 25, and as soon as it was dark, with the
torpedo covered with canvas on deck and twelve fifty-pound
boxes of dynamite in the pilot house, we
steamed around in Nictheroy Bay, hugging the
shore all of the way. To have loaded the torpedo
before we started on the necessarily hazardous trip
would have been extremely dangerous, for any accidental
pressure on one of its arms would have blown
all of us to pieces. We anchored in the lee of the
peninsular promontory, well out of sight of the rebel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
fleet, and as soon as it was daylight I unscrewed the
manhole of the torpedo and proceeded to pack it full
of dynamite. All of the men were either helping me
or intently watching the novel proceeding, for we
were not expecting visitors. I was just putting in
the last box of the explosive when there was a shrill
whistle and a launch from the “Sirius” swung
alongside. The lieutenant in charge of our unbidden
and most unwelcome guest jumped aboard of
us and came aft before I could brush the dynamite
from my arms.</p>

<p>“Who commands this craft?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I do,” I replied.</p>

<p>“What are you doing with that flag up there?”
pointing to the British ensign.</p>

<p>“That flag was there when I came aboard and took
command,” which was true. Then, seeing that he
thought I was trying to evade the question, I added:
“I am flying it for protection from a pirate fleet, just
as others are displaying it in Rio Bay and in the
city. Your commanding officer has sanctioned that
custom by his silence. I am an officer of the established
Brazilian Government, obeying the orders of
my superiors in Brazilian waters, and I claim the
right to take advantage of that custom, if I care to
do so, just as others have done and are doing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>“I think the other cases are different from yours,”
replied the lieutenant. “What is that?” pointing
to the dynamite.</p>

<p>“Examine it for yourself.”</p>

<p>“It looks like dynamite.”</p>

<p>“Probably.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I am ordered by Captain Lang to take
you on board Her Majesty’s ship ‘Sirius.’”</p>

<p>It was of no use to make a fight so I accompanied
him, with excessive and sarcastic politeness. He
took all of my crew with him, leaving a guard on the
tug. Captain Lang was on deck waiting for me and
was quite agitated when I was brought before him,
but he was much more heated before we parted company,
and it was a warm day to begin with.</p>

<p>“Captain Boynton, what does this mean?” he
roared at me.</p>

<p>“What does what mean?” I innocently inquired.</p>

<p>“Your lying over there in a vessel loaded with
munitions of war and flying the British flag?”</p>

<p>“It means simply that I am an officer in the Brazilian
Army, on duty under the guns of a rebel fleet, and
that I am flying the British flag for whatever virtue
it might have in protecting me from that pirate,
Admiral Mello. That flag has been used as a protection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
by many others and you have silently acquiesced
in such use of it.”</p>

<p>“But, sir, are you not aware that this is piracy?”</p>

<p>“I am not aware, sir, that it is any such thing.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you that it is piracy to fly the British
flag over the ship of another nation and carrying
munitions of war.”</p>

<p>“It might be just as well, Captain Lang, for you
to remember that you are not now on the high seas.
An act of the British Parliament is of no effect within
another country, and if you will consult your chart
you will find that we are in the enclosed waters of
Brazil. Under such conditions no mandate of yours
which affects my rights can be enforced, unless you
have the nerve to take the chances that go with your
act.”</p>

<p>“You may soon find to the contrary,” shouted the
captain, who was letting his temper get the best of
him. “I have a mind to send you to Admiral Mello
as a prisoner. You know what he would do to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Captain Lang,” I said jeeringly, “you know
you wouldn’t do that.”</p>

<p>“And pray why not, sir?”</p>

<p>“Because you dare not do it, and that’s why,” I
told him, as I pointed at the “Charleston” which,
with her decks cleared for action, was anchored only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
a few hundred yards off to port. “I dare you to do it.
I defy you to do it. Send me aboard the ‘Aquidaban’
if you dare.” I was making a strong bluff and I got
away with it. The outraged Britisher swelled up
with anger and turned almost purple, but he did not
reply to my taunt. Instead, he summoned the master
at arms and placed me in his charge, ordered his
launch, and dashed off to the “Charleston.” He
returned in half an hour and, without another word
to me, ordered a lieutenant to take me aboard the
“Charleston.”</p>

<p>I will not deny that I was a bit easier in my mind
when I saw my own flag flying over me, yet had I
known the treatment I was to receive under it, I
would have felt quite differently.</p>

<p>It was easy to see, from the reception which Captain
Picking gave me, that he had been influenced
by the attitude of Captain Lang, for he took about
the same view of my action. I told him that I was
an American citizen, temporarily in the employment
of the Brazilian Government, as were several other
Americans who loved fighting and excitement; that
I had violated no law of the United States or of
Brazil, and I demanded that I be set ashore. He
coldly informed me that I would be confined to the
ship, at least until he had consulted with the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
Minister and communicated with Washington.
Not only did Picking regard Mello as a rebel rather
than a pirate but he went even farther and recognized
him as a belligerent, which meant that he was
entitled to all the rights of war. This opinion was
shaped, undoubtedly, by the royalist commanders in
the harbor, whose superior rank seemed to have a
hypnotic effect on Picking, and their influence over
him was so strong that soon after I arrived on the
“Charleston” I was confined to my room, as a dangerous
character and a man who threatened the
peace of nations. With this decidedly unpleasant
recollection, however, it is a pleasure to know that
the other American naval officers, who arrived later,
took exactly my view of the whole situation and
became champions of my cause. They told Picking
that Mello was a pirate and should be treated as
such, and that I was being deprived of my liberty
without the slightest warrant of law, but they were
powerless to accomplish my release, as Picking was
in command, as the senior officer present, and all
of the correspondence with Washington was conducted
through him. Captain Terry, though he never
had met me and could not be charged with having
his opinion biassed by any personal relation, was
especially vigorous in urging that I be released and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
that Mello’s farcical revolution be suppressed without
further ceremony. He denounced my detention
as a disgrace to the American Navy and though he
and Picking had been bosom friends up to that time,
a coolness developed between them, on account of
the manner in which I was treated, that continued
until Picking’s death, years later.</p>

<p>The manner in which that old fighter, Rear
Admiral Benham, put an end to the “revolution” in
the following January, soon after his arrival at Rio,
should be well remembered, for it was a noble deed
and an example of the good judgment generally displayed
by American naval officers when they are not
hampered by foolish orders from Washington. In
the vain hope of arousing enthusiasm in his lost
cause, Mello had gone down the coast, where he figuratively
and literally took to the woods when he
saw the folly of his mission, leaving Da Gama in command
of the blockading fleet. The captains of several
American merchant ships, who had been prevented
for weeks from landing their cargoes for Rio, appealed
to Admiral Benham who took prompt action.
To show his contempt for the rebels, whom he properly
regarded as pirates, making no secret of the fact,
Admiral Benham assigned the smallest ship in his
squadron, the little “Detroit,” commanded by that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
great little man, Commander (now Rear Admiral, retired)
W. H. Brownson, to escort the merchantmen
up to the docks. At the same time he warned Da
Gama not to carry out his threat to fire on them when
they crossed his line. With his ship cleared for action,
as were the “San Francisco,” “New York,”
“Charleston,” and “Newark,” which stood guard over
the rebel fleet, at a considerable distance, Brownson
stood in alongside one of the merchantmen. He
steamed over close to the “Trajano,” on which Da
Gama’s flag was flying, and which, with the “Guanabara,”
was guarding the shore.</p>

<p>“I will recognize no accidental shots,” shouted
Brownson to the rebel admiral, “so don’t fire any.
If you open fire I will respond, and if you reply to
that I will sink you.”</p>

<p>As the merchant ship came in line the “Trajano”
fired a shot across her bow. Brownson replied
instantly with a six-pound shell which exploded so
close to the “Trajano” that it threw water on her
forward deck. A musket shot was fired from the
“Guanabara,” and it was answered and silenced with
a bullet from the “Detroit.”</p>

<p>After seeing his charge safely tied up to the dock
Brownson circled contemptuously around the “Trajano”
and ordered a marine to send a rifle shot into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
her sternpost, as an evidence of his esteem for her
commander. The discomfited Da Gama, who was
looking for some excuse to end his hopeless revolt,
fell over himself getting into his launch, raced over
to the “Detroit” and tendered his sword to Brownson.
Brownson told him he had not demanded his
surrender, as he seemed to think, and could not
accept it, but that he must keep his hands off American
shipping if he wished to continue his mortal existence.
The “revolution” ended right there, but
unfortunately I was not present to witness its collapse.
The august naval authorities were scandalized
when this display of good sense was reported to
them and they carefully prepared a message of censure
to Benham for permitting such conduct, but
before it was despatched the New York morning
newspapers reached Washington—and after a perusal
of their enthusiastic editorials on the subject a
message of commendation was sent to him instead.</p>

<p>During my confinement on the “Charleston” I
was occasionally allowed on deck for exercise, but I
had no other diversion, which really was an aggravation,
than to watch the intermittent bombardment of
the city and the regularly scheduled exchange of
shots between the rebel fleet and the forts. In hope
of meeting with greater success Mello would sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
engage the forts with several of his ships and,
as time wore on, there was some improvement in
the marksmanship on both sides, though nothing like
reasonable accuracy was ever attained. The only
incident which was at all exciting was the sinking of
the “Javary,” one of Mello’s monitors. A shell from
Fort Sao Joao dropped between her turrets and as
she heeled over from the explosion an accidental
shot from Fort Santa Cruz struck her below the
water line. She went down by the stern with a rush.
The guns in her forward turret were pointed toward
the town and they were fired, in a spirit of sheer
bravado, just as she disappeared. Mello threw a few
shells into the city every day, as evidence that he
was still in rebellion, but I was told that less than
half a dozen of them did any damage and they certainly
produced little excitement. Soldanha da Gama
came out in the open and joined forces with Mello
while I was on the “Charleston.”</p>

<p>I was not allowed to communicate with any one on
shore, and, except from hearsay, Floriano had no
means of knowing whether I was alive or dead. Captain
Picking claimed to have been told by a church
dignitary, who, of course, was a friend of Mello, that
it would be unsafe to set me ashore as I was certain
to be assassinated by Mello sympathizers, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
doubtless was a subterfuge by which he sought to
justify his position. After I had been subjected to
this outrageous treatment for two months—from
September 26 to November 26—I was suddenly
and without any explanation transferred to the
“Detroit,” which immediately put to sea. Off Cape
Frio we met another “Sirius,” a Lamport &amp; Holt
liner bound for New York, and, in charge of Ensign
Jas. F. Carter, I was transferred to her. We reached
New York on December 19, 1893, and I was taken
to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. An hour after my arrival
a message was received from Washington ordering
my release. The Navy Department had me on
its hands, did not know what to do with me, and
finally, in line with the vacillating policy then in
vogue, took that cowardly method of getting me
away from the danger zone. Adhering to my rule of
never talking about myself or my troubles I made no
complaint, but I have always considered that my
treatment was a disgrace, and most of the naval
officers who were in Rio at the same time will bear
me out in that statement. It was the sort of treatment
one might expect in an absolute monarchy but
not in a republic, with all of its false boasts about the
freedom of the citizen and protection of his rights.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>REVOLUTION AS A FINE ART</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NOTWITHSTANDING the discouragement I
had met with in Brazil, and the manner in
which I had been deprived of a fresh fortune and
much excitement by the discovery of my plan to send
Admiral Mello and his rebel flagship skyward with
a beautiful torpedo of my own invention and construction,
the passion for adventure was still strong
within me, but I was unable to gratify it with
the resources then at my command. My finances,
already considerably crimped by my extravagant way
of living and several unprofitable years, had been
still further depleted by my long and idle stay at
Rio Janeiro, while waiting for the Mello insurrection
to become an actuality, and I felt it the part of
wisdom to assure myself of an income until something
opened up that would be more exciting than
working for a living.</p>

<p>Therefore, soon after my prompt release from the
Brooklyn Navy Yard, just before Christmas in 1893,
after my outrageous treatment at the hands of Captain
Picking and the Navy Department, I engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
with the Maxim Powder &amp; Torpedo Company to
travel through Central and South America and the
West Indies and sell munitions of war to governments,
or to any one who had the necessary cash or
could furnish reasonable security. But before setting
forth I organized, with several of my friends,
the International Export &amp; Trading Company.
Through this concern it was proposed to arm and
finance any promising revolution I might encounter
whose leaders would guarantee, in the event of success,
to pay us anywhere from three to ten times the
amount of money we had actually invested in the
enterprise, and give us valuable concessions besides.
No get-rich-quick scheme that was ever devised
equals the financing of a revolution, when it succeeds
and is honestly managed. The experience tables of
the turbid tropics prove that the chances are somewhat
against the success of these outbursts of predatory
patriotism, but the prospects of failure are
amply discounted by the exorbitant terms of the contract;
the great trouble is that they generally are in
charge of men who have no more respect for a written
agreement than for a moral obligation. The man
who bets at random on the honesty of revolutionary
leaders in Latin America, no matter how sincere their
promises nor what odds they offer, stands a much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
better chance of winning from a faro game operated
with a two-card box, but as I had a personal acquaintance
with or knowledge of most of the disturbing
elements in those days, and knew how far they could
ordinarily be trusted, I thought I might run across
one or two with whom it would be safe to do business.
In case any such ambitious ones were found I
intended to become an active participant in the proceedings,
as a sort of guarantee of good faith and to
increase my interest in them.</p>

<p>Determined to tackle the hardest proposition first,
I boarded an Atlas liner for Hayti, where old Florville
Hippolyte was at the zenith of his power. I
knew that while I had been smuggling Chinamen into
Australia, General Legitime, whom I had accompanied
into exile at Jamaica when President Salomon
deported him for plotting against the government, at
the same time that he conveyed to me a broad hint
to leave the country without a delay of more than
a few hours, had returned to the island in 1888, after
an absence of more than three years, and had led a
temporarily successful revolt through which he had
himself elected President of the provisional government,
in succession to the man who had exiled him.
Gen. Seide Thelemaque promptly organized an opposing
government at Cape Haitien, with Gen. Hippolyte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
at the head of it. Thelemaque was soon afterward
killed in battle but Hippolyte continued the revolution.
Through its navy the United States gave him
its “moral support,” which is a powerful thing when
intelligently directed, and within a year from the
time he landed in Hayti to lead his little rebellion,
Legitime was compelled to again return ingloriously
to his haven in Jamaica. Two months later, in October,
1889, Hippolyte was formally elected President
and he continued in power until he died on horseback,
at the head of his army, near Port au Prince, in the
Spring of 1896.</p>

<p>Because of my affiliation with Legitime, whom I
had mistakenly picked out as the coming man in
Hayti, Hippolyte and I had quarrelled just before
Legitime and I were ordered from the country; but
that had been years before, and I deluded myself with
the belief that, if he had not forgotten the affair, it
had been forgiven, for there is supposed to be some
sort of honor even among soldiers of fortune and the
men with whom, at different times and under varying
conditions, they ally themselves. The lovers of
liberty, and lucre, who command insurrections are
out chiefly for what there is in it for themselves,
while the simple soldiers of fortune, like myself, are
in the game mainly for the excitement and amusement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
of conflict. It is against the ethics of the
profession of promoting trouble for the members of
one faction to cherish grudges against the other,
except perhaps under conditions involving personal
honor, and that is not often at stake. However,
I soon learned that Hippolyte, who was essentially
a savage with a lot of uncultured cunning, was no
believer in the unwritten revolutionary rules.</p>

<p>The steamer reached Port au Prince in the morning
and I went to the Hotel Bellevue, which faced
the park, directly opposite the presidential palace.
I had just finished breakfast when an American quadroon
named Belford, who boasted the proud title of
Admiral of the Haytian Navy and with whom I had
become well acquainted during my previous visit,
entered the hotel. He recognized me instantly and
after an exchange of greetings and some random
remarks about the old days, he wanted to know what
I was doing there. I handed him my card, showing
that I was the representative of the Maxim Powder
&amp; Torpedo Co.</p>

<p>“But what is your real business?” he inquired
with a smile.</p>

<p>“The card states it correctly.”</p>

<p>“How long are you going to stay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>“At least long enough to sell old Hippolyte a good
bill of goods, I hope.”</p>

<p>“You are not going to see the old man himself?”
he incredulously inquired.</p>

<p>“Surely. I hope to see him to-day.”</p>

<p>“You’d better be careful, Boynton. He remembers
you in a way that is likely to make trouble for
you.”</p>

<p>“He ought to have forgotten all about our little
difference by this time, or at least he should not harbor
hatred of me.”</p>

<p>“The old man has a long memory. He never forgets
and I never have known him to forgive.”</p>

<p>I laughed at his friendly anxiety but he continued
in the same strain. While we were talking we saw
a young officer coming up the path to the hotel.
“Here comes one of the old man’s aides,” said Belford.
“He’s after you already.”</p>

<p>I told him it was impossible, for I had been in town
only a few hours, but he insisted he was right and
quickly left me so we should not be found together.
I stepped into a side room where the young officer
came up to see me in a few minutes, guided by the
hotel proprietor.</p>

<p>“This is Captain Boynton?” he said, with more of
declaration than inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>“At your service, sir.”</p>

<p>“President Hippolyte requests you to call on him
at three o’clock this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Present my compliments to the President and
tell him I will be at the palace at that hour,” I replied.</p>

<p>Belford rejoined me when the aide was out of
sight. He said he did not like the looks of things
and advised me to go back on board the steamer,
which was still in the harbor. I told him I thought
he was unnecessarily alarmed, but that anyway I
had come to Hayti as an American citizen on legitimate
business, and I proposed to stay until it had
been transacted.</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon I donned full evening
dress, according to the court requirement, and
presented myself at the palace, where I was at once
ushered into Hippolyte’s private reception room.</p>

<p>“What brings you here, Captain Boynton?” was
the sharp salutation of the old black butcher.</p>

<p>“I am selling munitions of war,” I replied, and
handed him my card.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” he asked, with a look as keen as a
razor and in a voice almost as cutting.</p>

<p>“That is all.”</p>

<p>With this assurance, which seemed to carry conviction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
Hippolyte relaxed considerably and shook
hands with me.</p>

<p>“I want to sell you some smokeless powder,” I told
him. “It is the latest thing and is a great aid to
annihilation.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want it,” was his brusque response.</p>

<p>“It is almost noiseless, as well,” I urged. “With
its use an enemy would find it difficult to locate
your troops.”</p>

<p>“That is worse yet,” he said, with as much of a
smile as his ugly face was acquainted with. “We
want powder that will make much smoke and lots of
noise.”</p>

<p>I told him I had that kind too, and other things
which he ought to have.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, with a suggestion of impatience,
“go to the Minister of War and get your order, and
then get out. Where are you going from here?”</p>

<p>“To Santo Domingo.”</p>

<p>“Good. I’ll help you. The ‘Toussaint l’Ouverture’
[a little gunboat named for the negro Napoleon
of Hayti] will take you there when you are ready.
You must be prepared to sail within a week.”</p>

<p>“Why all this hurry?” I inquired in great surprise.
“It has been years since I was in Port au
Prince and I want to revisit old familiar places and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
renew acquaintance with old friends, if there are
any left.” I might have added that I disputed his
right to prescribe the length of my stay, but I did
not wish to provoke a row with the old fellow, at
that time.</p>

<p>He almost beamed on me as he replied, “I like
you, Captain, but I don’t want you in Hayti. You
can stay just one week.”</p>

<p>I told him I earnestly hoped he would extend the
time limit and left him, backing out, if you please.
I went direct to the Minister of War, who made out
a memorandum covering a large consignment of
fighting materials and said he would send the official
order to my hotel, which he did. Soon after my
return to the hotel I was introduced to Freeman Halstead,
the correspondent of a great New York newspaper,
who had been in Hayti for some time. I had
noticed him talking with the proprietor that morning,
when Hippolyte’s aide came to the hotel in search
of me. In the interval he had cabled his paper that
I was in Hayti and had received reply, he said, to
“stick to Boynton until further orders.” I told him
I had no news and did not expect to make any, but
he declared that he would stand by to see what happened.
He said he was on an intimate footing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
Hippolyte and suggested that he might be able to
help me.</p>

<p>During the evening I received a call from an old
German acquaintance, named Hefferman, and at his
invitation I accompanied him to his home. His wife
necessarily was a native negress for, on account of
the stringent anti-foreign law, all of his property
stood in her name. He confided to me the fact that
he was the agent for Gen. Mannigat, another would-be
revolutionary leader who was in exile at Jamaica,
and that with the aid of a French woman, known as
Natalie, of whom Hippolyte was greatly enamoured,
he had just formulated a plan to kidnap the President.
His scheme was to have Natalie give Hippolyte
some drugged wine and, while he was unconscious,
put him in a box and bundle him off to a
waiting sailing ship which would proceed to Jamaica,
where the deposed and dopey President would be
turned over to Mannigat, who could make such terms
with him as he desired. To the mind of my German
friend this would establish a new standard in revolutions
and he wanted me to share in his glory, in
return for my assistance. I complimented him on
his idea of stealing a President, which, under such
conditions as he described, might be accomplished,
but pointed out that to make his coup successful he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
must have Mannigat on the ground with a force sufficiently
large to seize and hold the government when
Hippolyte was removed; that unless this was done
both of them would be frozen out by some cockaded
criminal who was waiting for just such an opportunity.
I told him if the conditions which I had
stipulated could be complied with I would be glad to
finance and equip the revolt, subject to satisfactory
guarantees, but that as it stood I could have nothing
to do with it.</p>

<p>It was late when we finished our talk and I made
the mistake of spending the night with Hefferman
who, as it turned out, was vaguely suspected of
being disloyal to Hippolyte, or at least out of sympathy
with him, though there was no notion that he
was Mannigat’s confidential agent. As a result of
my long visit to the German, the mistaken suspicion
was created that I had come to Hayti to plot against
the President and was trying to draw Hefferman
into my plans. This suspicion soon became apparent.
Halstead and Belford told me there was no
doubt, from what they had heard at the palace and
elsewhere, that Hippolyte thought I had lied to him
and believed I was there to make trouble for him.
On the sixth day after my arrival Belford told me
he was to take me on the “Toussaint” the next day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
ostensibly to convey me to Santo Domingo, but that
he had secret orders, from Hippolyte himself, to see
to it that I “fell overboard” well out at sea and was
not rescued. He begged me to get out of the country
that day, as he would have to obey orders or
“walk the plank” himself. Halstead brought me
word that I was to be arrested the next day and he
was positive that I was to be “shot while attempting
to escape” or put out of the way in some such fashion.
That made it look as though the old scoundrel
meant business and I concluded to give him the slip.
Halstead declared he was going with me and as I
knew I could rely on him I let him arrange the
details of our departure. Pretending that he was
going to Jacmel he sent his trunk and mine, both
marked as his own, on board a Dutch steamship
which had come into port that morning and was to
leave the next day.</p>

<p>Against the protests of both Halstead and Belford
I paid Hippolyte a parting call that afternoon. I
thanked him for his courtesy and the order for arms
and told him I would be ready to sail the next morning
on the “Toussaint,” which I expected would be
waiting for me. The old villain was in his happiest
mood and even joked with me about latter day conditions
in Hayti as compared with those which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
existed when I was there before. If I had not known
what was in his mind I might have thought he was
simply glad I was going away without having stirred
up any trouble for him, but, knowing his murderous
plans, I appreciated that he was gloating over me.
The strange situation amused me so that I laughed
immoderately at his jokes and, as all of his gloating
was to be in anticipation, I let him enjoy himself to
his fill.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my friend,” he said as I was leaving.
“I wish you a quiet and peaceful trip to-morrow.”</p>

<p>He chuckled over his irony and I smiled back at
him, with my thanks. That evening, after Halstead
had loudly announced in the hotel office that he expected
a visitor at eleven o’clock and wished him
sent directly to his room, he and I slipped out by a
back way, went to a lonely spot on the beach where
he had a boat in waiting, and rowed out to the Dutch
ship. On account of his newspaper connection Halstead
had much influence with the captain and when
the ship was searched for me the next morning, on
the pretence that I was a political prisoner who was
attempting to escape, I was not found.</p>

<p>We went to Jamaica, where Halstead formerly had
lived, and there I got in touch with General Mannigat,
and went over his plans against Hippolyte. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
impressed me as a fighter and reasonably honest and
he convinced me that he had a considerable following
in Hayti. He was positive that if he had enough
arms he could capture the country, so I arranged
with him that the International Export &amp; Trading
Co., my concern for promoting revolutions, would
ship him twenty-five thousand dollars’ worth of
munitions of war on the receipt of three thousand
dollars in cash and in the further consideration on his
part of a pledge that thirty-three per cent of the customs
receipts at Port au Prince would be turned over
to us, until we had been paid two hundred and twenty
thousand dollars, which was at the rate of ten
dollars for every one dollar that we risked. I drew
up a contract to this effect, which he signed, and
sent the order for the arms to New York, with
instructions to fill it when Mannigat sent the three
thousand dollars. The money never was sent, but I
still hold the contract, as a souvenir.</p>

<p>Mannigat was in doubt as to how soon the requisite
amount of cash could be raised, so it was arranged
that I should be advised when it was forwarded to
New York, in order that I might return and take an
active part in his operations, and I went on to the
Isthmus of Panama, then a part of Colombia. I
stopped at the International Hotel, probably so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
named because it was the worst in the world, at
Colon, and made no secret of my business there, or
anywhere else; in fact I rather boasted of it, because
of the novelty of being engaged in legitimate commerce,
even though I was filibustering on the side
when the inducements were attractive. Within a few
days I was approached by a young Colombian who
had been educated in New Jersey and was a good
deal of an American in his ideas. Without telling
me what they were for, but giving me grounds for
drawing my own conclusions, he ordered three thousand
Winchester rifles and the same number of revolvers,
with a large quantity of ammunition. He said
he would give me New York exchange in part payment
of the bill the following day, and that the balance
would be paid when they were delivered, at a
point to be designated later.</p>

<p>During the night that came on the heels of this
conversation I heard a few pistol shots but paid no
attention to them, as there seemed to be no resultant
excitement. In the morning I discovered that two
hundred alleged revolutionary plotters, of whom my
young customer of the day before was one of the
chiefs, had been arrested between darkness and dawn
and rounded up in a big yard, surrounded by a high
fence, directly back of the hotel. At breakfast I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
looked at curiously and I soon heard talk that I was
also to be taken into custody. A fat and officious
English butcher, who was employed by the Governor
of Panama to spy on all English-speaking visitors,
had reported my meeting with the supposed rebel
leader and had advised that I be arrested on the
ground that I was fomenting internal disorder. I
knew, of course, that I could establish my innocence,
but the administration of the law in Latin America
is such a fearful and wonderful thing that it might
take me weeks or months to do it, and, besides that,
I had no desire for a clash with the Colombian Government
and the notoriety which would result from
it. Therefore, when trouble appeared certain I took
refuge with the British consul, who was just then
the acting American consul. I explained the situation
to him and, while maintaining that my business
was perfectly legitimate, denied that I had sold the
young patriot any arms, which was technically true
as the deal had not been closed, or that I knew he
was involved in any proposed revolution. The consul
sympathized with me, in compliance with the
most important of the unwritten rules of the consular
service, but, after satisfying himself that the
Governor had been prejudiced against me, he advised
that the easiest and quickest way out of the difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
was the best. The steamship “Ferdinand de Lesseps”
was leaving the next day for the Spanish Main,
which was where I wanted to go, and I went on
board of her, under escort of the consul. I was running
into more trouble on this trip than I had ever
before encountered in ten times the same length of
time and it began to look as though I had brought a
hoodoo on myself by forsaking the intricate paths of
adventure for the broad, not the straight and narrow,
way of ordinary trade.</p>

<p>Not wishing to take any further chances with
Colombia I did not even go ashore at Savanilla or
Cartagena but went on to Venezuela, where Gen.
Joachim Crespo was now in command. The rule of
President Palacio, whose supporters had betrayed
my old friend Guzman Blanco, had lasted but two
years and was followed in rapid succession by a series
of revolutions. The betrayal of Guzman seemed to
have put a curse on the country, for there was disorder
all through the Palacio regime and immediately
following it there were three dictatorships in
one year. Finally, in October, 1892, General Crespo
entered Caracas and restored peace so completely
that shortly before my arrival he was elected
Constitutional President. I recalled that when
Crespo was a young staff officer I had recommended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
him to Guzman for his loyalty and intelligence, and,
if he knew of this incident, I thought it might now
prove of advantage to me in my new occupation.</p>

<p>As we were warping into the dock at La Guaira
the chief of police, who was a new man to me, came
aboard and looked over the baggage of all of the
passengers who were to land there. When we had
disembarked he slipped his arm through mine and
quietly told me I was under arrest and to go with
him. Three officers stepped up behind us to enforce
his orders and they all looked me over as though
they suspected that I might be full of dynamite.
Instead, I was full of questions and protests, but not
a word could I get out of them as to the reason for
the surprising proceeding. They escorted me to the
police station at the end of the long wharf and after
I had been carefully searched and relieved of everything
but my money I was taken to the fort on the
hill and placed in a strong room, if not a comfortable
one. The next day I was removed to the Casa Publica,
or public prison, at Caracas, where I was not
surprised to find several old acquaintances. Gen.
Tosta Garcia, whom I had known intimately in the
old days, was Governor of the Federal District and
had authority over the prison, but, unfortunately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
he was out of the city and the Intendiente, or Vice-Governor,
who was a stranger to me, was in charge.</p>

<p>Soon after my arrival I was haled to his office,
apparently to be put through an examination, but
before he could ask me a question I burst out on him
with a bitter denunciation of my arrest. I told him
who I was and what I was doing and that if the
search of my baggage, which undoubtedly had been
made, had failed to establish my identity there were
many prominent men in Caracas who would vouch
for me, including his own immediate superior. I
urged him to explain the reason for my detention; but
he would say nothing, beyond a veiled suggestion
that it had been ordered by the President.</p>

<p>“Present my compliments to General Crespo,” I
said, in reply to this amazing intimation, “and
remind him, if you please, that I was his friend when
my friendship was worth having. Tell him, too, that
if this is the way he treats his friends he is a contemptible
snake,” or words to that effect.</p>

<p>The Intendiente was plainly surprised at both my
words and my manner and without asking a question
he sent me back to the prison. The next morning he
directed my release in person. “There is no reason
for you to be angry with General Crespo,” he said,
by way of explanation, “for he has ordered your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
unconditional release. You are free to go where you
please and stay as long as you please.”</p>

<p>“Which,” I replied, “is no compliment to me and
in no way lessens the outrage to which I have been
subjected.”</p>

<p>From the Casa Publica I went to the Grand Hotel
and when my traps arrived there I found that they
had been, as I supposed, thoroughly ransacked, but
nothing was missing. In the following days I
encountered many men whom I had known well or
intimately fifteen years before, when Caracas was
my home for a longer period than any other city in
the world had ever been, and I was soon enjoying
myself renewing acquaintance with old friends,
among whom were members of some of the oldest
families in Venezuela. To all of them who asked if
I had seen the President, I said I had not and that
I did not propose to call on him, as I had been shamefully
mistreated by his order. Two or three weeks
after my arrival the Minister of War sent for me and
said he understood I was the agent of a house that
sold munitions of war. I said that was true, and
when he expressed surprise that I had not called on
him I told him I had been subjected to a great injustice
through him and through General Crespo, and
that while I did not expect an apology from either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
one I could at least show them how I felt about it
by staying away from them, even though I punished
myself and my firm by so doing. However, if he
was interested, I said I would be glad to show him
my samples and quote prices. He said he was interested,
and proved it by giving me a large order.
Beyond a shrug of the shoulders, which might have
meant any one of a dozen things, he made no comment
on my complaint of ill treatment. Not long
after this I went one evening, by invitation, to the
home of a doctor friend of mine and was astonished
to be ushered into the presence of President Crespo.
It developed that the doctor was one of Crespo’s intimate
associates, though I had not known it up to that
time. The President greeted me with a smile and
said, as he extended his hand, “As Mahomet would
not come to the mountain, the mountain had to come
to Mahomet.”</p>

<p>“I never expected that I would have to apologize
to the man who, I thought, owed me an apology, even
though I did not look for it, but that is the situation
I find myself in now,” I said to him. “Courtesy compels
me to apologize for not having called on you to
pay my respects. But,” I added, “I am a good deal
of a red Indian, which means that I am slow to forgive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
an injury, and I felt that you had done me a
great injustice.”</p>

<p>“That was a most unfortunate incident,” he said,
with evident sincerity. “I am going to explain the
reason for my action and let you be the judge as to
the justification for it.” He then told me that five
or six weeks previously a circular had been sent out
by an American agent of a Central American country,
in which it was stated that a man named Boynton,
of whom a description was given, was leaving
New York ostensibly to sell munitions of war, but
that his real purpose was to assassinate President
Hippolyte, of Hayti, and President Crespo, of Venezuela.
He said, of course, he had not connected me
with the alleged anarchist, for that was what the
man was stated to be, or he would never have issued
the order for my arrest.</p>

<p>“What would you have done if you had been in
my place?” asked Crespo when he had completed his
explanation.</p>

<p>“Precisely what you did.”</p>

<p>“Then, with that explanation, I apologize for the
trouble I caused you.”</p>

<p>“That removes the last sting,” I told him, and we
settled down for a long talk. He recalled the fact that
I had commended him to General Guzman and expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
what seemed to be genuine sorrow over the
downfall of that great chieftain. Crespo was very
different in appearance from the slender young aide I
had known in the old days and was now a big, tall,
and well-developed man. He had been President before,
from 1884 to 1886, as a dummy for Guzman, so
he knew something of both the responsibilities and the
dangers of the office. His manner impressed me and
I took a pronounced liking to him. He said he had
directed the Minister of War to buy a bill of goods
from me and to purchase all future war supplies
through me, and I told him I had already received
the first order.</p>

<p>“I want you to be as good a friend to me as you
were to General Guzman,” he said in parting. I told
him I expected to be in Venezuela for some time and
would gladly be of service to him in any way that I
could.</p>

<p>A few nights later I was summoned to an adjoining
house where I again met Crespo and had a long
talk with him alone. He asked me how much I
expected to make in my new business. Without
going into any of the details of my plans and giving
myself the benefit of every doubt, I told him I ought
to make fifty thousand dollars a year. He said he did
not know whether he could pay me that much in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
salary but in one way and another he would see that
I lost nothing if I would consent to stay with him.
Through a visit to the United States shortly before
he took the field for the presidency he had learned
of the work of our Pinkertons, and had become impressed
with the need of a secret detective force of
his own. It was the same idea that Guzman had
when I became his confidential agent, but Crespo
wanted it worked out on a broader scale so that he
could be kept advised as to the movements and plans
of his most important enemies, and truthfully told of
the fluctuations in public sentiment. He asked me to
undertake the organization of a force of secret service
agents, whom I was to employ and pay in my own
discretion and for such time as I needed them, and
I consented. A means of communication was established
through an unused rear door to his private
apartments at Santa Inez Palace, to which I was
given a key, and I was to have access to him at any
hour of the day or night. I told him, however, that
our intimate relationship had best not be known, so
that I could keep on friendly terms with all classes,
and that I would openly criticise him, and even
denounce him, whenever it served my purpose and
his welfare.</p>

<p>In the two years that followed the relations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
between Crespo and myself became as cordial as they
were confidential. Though of humble origin, and fully
half Indian, there must have been blue blood somewhere
among his ancestors, for he was a polished gentleman
in his manners and extremely magnetic. He
was tremendously powerful and while he weighed all
of two hundred and fifty pounds he was so well built
and so tall that he did not look heavy. He put me in
mind of a square-rigged ship of graceful lines, with
all of her canvas set. He could hardly read and write
but he had an insatiable thirst for information, and
his close friends used to read to him at night until
he fell asleep. He never drank to excess; was a good
husband and an indulgent father, and the most continent
Venezuelano I ever knew. He thought he was
honest and he certainly was loyal to his friends and
stubborn in his opinions. He was so strong in his
friendship, in fact, that he was sometimes imposed on,
for with a man whom he liked and trusted he was as
credulous as a child. The advice and warnings of
Donna Crespo and myself caused him to turn a deaf
ear to many of his evil-minded followers but we could
not silence all of them, and their influence prevented
him from being a really great President. In the
face of a danger that could be seen, no matter how
great, he was entirely without fear, but he was in constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
dread of assassination. He was skilful in the
use of revolver and rifle and was passionately fond of
firearms, perhaps because of his besetting fear.
When the first shipment of Maxim guns was received
he had me set one of them up in the yard back of
Santa Inez Palace. He examined it carefully, with
all the pleasure of a child with a new toy, tested its
flexibility and radius of action, and then cut “J.
Crespo” with a stream of bullets in a brick wall sixty
feet away, and gleefully surveyed his handiwork.</p>

<p>Not long after entering his employ I was instrumental
in saving his life. He had gone for an outing
to an <i>atto</i>, or ranch, twenty miles from Guacara,
which was near Valencia, where Gen. Ignacio
Andrade was then stationed. The night after he left
Caracas I learned through one of my agents that two
hundred men were to start out at midnight ostensibly
for Saint Lucia, but when part way there they were
to proceed diagonally across the plains to the ranch
at which Crespo was stopping, where they planned
to capture and shoot him. I employed a dare-devil
nephew of Guzman, whom I knew I could trust, to
gallop at top speed to Andrade with a letter in which
I told him of the plot. He immediately sent a messenger
to the President to warn him of his danger,
and followed him quickly with five hundred troops.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
Crespo was found two or three miles out on the
ranch, and by his order the soldiers were hidden in
and around the farm buildings. When the rebels
came up they were surrounded before they knew
what had happened. Their leader was shot on the
spot and his lieutenants were imprisoned. Andrade
did just what any other good soldier would have done,
yet it was this act more than anything else, I have
always believed, that caused Crespo to select him as
his successor, with tragic results. Though deeply
grateful to me he considered that he owed his life
to Andrade.</p>

<p>Several other plots against Crespo’s life were discovered
and frustrated by the effective secret service
I had created, and most of those who were implicated
in them were properly punished. One of these
murder schemes, which proved to be more serious
than I at first supposed, involved the telephone in
Crespo’s private room. The plan was to substitute
for the regular receiver one which looked exactly like
it but was not insulated, and then, when the President
had answered a call and was holding the receiver
against his ear, switch into the telephone the full
current from an electric light dynamo, in the hope
that the shock would be strong enough to kill him.
My first inkling of this came from an American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
electrical engineer and while I satisfied myself that
such a plot had been laid I never was able to get to
the bottom of it, though I had an intelligent suspicion
as to who was responsible for it.</p>

<p>Crespo was keenly appreciative of my services and
was anxious to put me in the way of making a fortune,
to take the place of the ones I had lost in
speculation and in trying to outdo the King of the Belgians
in riotous living, to which I have ever been
prone. There were then two lines of horse cars in
Caracas. It seemed to me there was a good opening
for an electric system, and through Crespo’s influence
I secured a blanket franchise that was most sweeping
in its terms. It gave me the right to parallel the
existing lines and build new ones on any streets that
I selected, all over the city, or, as it was unfortunately
worded “all around the city.” The only literal Spanish
equivalent for this, as far as I knew, was circumvalorate,
and that word was used to describe my
rights. I was also given the right to condemn waterfalls
for thirty miles around to generate electricity.
The most desirable of these natural power plants was
over toward Macuto, and was owned by one of the
Guzman family. I arranged to sell my franchise to
a Brooklyn street railway man for three hundred
thousand dollars, but when he came to investigate it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
he found that <i>circumvalorate</i> meant exactly what
it said, “all around the city,” and that outside of the
lines parallel to the existing street railways, which
were specifically provided for, he could do nothing
more than build a belt line along the outside edge of
the city. Crespo tried to have the franchise amended
so that it would give me, in plain terms, just what I
wanted and what I thought I had, but the amendment
failed of passage by one vote, that of the Guzman
descendant, who feared that my next move
would be the condemnation of his waterfall. Naturally,
the deal fell through. That one miserable
word cost me just three hundred thousand dollars. I
never have used it since then until now; it is too
expensive for ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1895 Crespo was asked to
revive the concession which Guzman Blanco had
granted to the old Manoa Company, and which had
subsequently been annulled. This concession, which
had passed through several hands and was then held
by the Orinoco Company, Limited, took in the entire
delta of the Orinoco and covered eight million acres
of land, an empire that was wonderfully rich in a
variety of resources. Crespo, believing that here was
an unusual opportunity for me to rebuild my fortunes
and for him to prove his gratitude, notified the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
Orinoco Co. that he would restore the concession provided
I was made manager of it. They were quite
willing to employ me in this capacity for, without
any regard to what ability I might have as a manager,
they were assured of having the government
with them, which is a consideration of first importance
throughout South and Central America. I was
by no means anxious to go with them but I finally
yielded to Crespo’s advice and accepted the appointment,
though without binding myself to stay more
than six months. Crespo gave me, in effect, the
power of life and death over every one on the concession,
and put me above the law. He instructed the
Governor of the Delta Territorio that whatever I did
was well done, and that I was not to be held to
account for it. I left for Santa Catalina, the headquarters
of the concession, on December 17, 1895,
the day that President Cleveland sent to Congress
his message on the Venezuelan boundary question.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>AT WAR WITH CASTRO</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was in vexed Venezuela that I was destined to
end my days of deviltry, but not until after a protracted
warfare, none the less bitter because it was
conducted at long range, with Castro the Contemptible,
who came into power two years after I had
finally settled down at Santa Catalina as manager for
the Orinoco Company. Cipriano Castro had been in
Congress as Diputado, or Member of the House, from
one of the Andean districts while I was in Caracas
with President Crespo, and though he was regarded
as a good fighter and a disturbing element he was
never considered as a presidential possibility. Had
that unhappy prospect ever been suggested it could
easily have been imagined that he would, as he abundantly
did, prove himself the “Vulture of Venezuela,”
the most despotic and dishonest ruler with which that
unfortunate country has ever been cursed, and the
most cunning.</p>

<p>With all of my hatred for Castro and everything
pertaining to him it must be admitted that he was
an exceedingly shrewd scoundrel; had he been half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
as honest he could have made himself the greatest
man in South America. He supported Anduesa Palacio,
the deposed President who had betrayed Guzman
Blanco, in his final campaign against Crespo,
before the latter was recognized as Dictator, and
defeated General Morales in the battle of Tariba on
May 15, 1892. For some time after that he was in
full control of that section of the country, but with
the firm establishment of the new regime he gave up
the fight. In recognition of the military ability he
had displayed, Crespo offered to make him Collector
of Customs at Puerto Cabello. He declined the
position but, egotistically exaggerating the purpose
of the proffer, he pompously promised Crespo that he
would not attempt to overthrow his government. He
then came to Congress, where he would have been
almost unnoticed but for the amusement he created
by solemnly removing his shoes and putting on
black kid gloves every time he sat down to the, to
him, herculean task of drafting a bill. He was as
rough and uncouth as the rest of the mountaineers;
short of stature, secretive of mind, and suspicious of
every one, excepting only a few of his brother brigands
from the Andes. At the expiration of his term
he returned to the hills and bought a farm just across
the Colombian border. He posed as a cattle-raiser,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
but all of the reports that reached Caracas said he was
much more of a cattle-rustler, or stealer. He was
a persistent tax-dodger and his herd, which was said
to show fifty different brands that represented as
many thefts, was driven back and forth across the
border to avoid the Venezuelan and Colombian collectors.
He was engaged in this profitable pastime
when I left Caracas, and had disappeared from all
political and revolutionary calculations.</p>

<p>I first arrived at Santa Catalina, whither I had
gone on the urgent advice of Crespo, early in 1896.
It was a straggling little town, with the company’s
headquarters, a large wooden building containing
forty rooms, which was used for both residential and
administrative purposes, standing close to the bank
of the Piacoa River, a branch of the Orinoco, opposite
the lower end of the Island of Tortola—the
Iwana of Sir Walter Raleigh. The building contained
a store, with a large supply of goods adapted
to the needs of colonists in a new and tropical country,
and around it were carpenter, blacksmith, and
machine shops. The company also owned three small
steamers, which were used to bring supplies from
Trinidad and run back and forth to Barrancas, thirty
miles upstream at the head of the Macareo River, the
main estuary of the Orinoco, through which all of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
commerce passes. The Atlantic Ocean was one hundred
and fifty miles below us and Ciudad Bolivar, the
principal city on the Orinoco and the head of all-the-year
navigation, was one hundred and eighty miles
above.</p>

<p>Tradition says that Santa Catalina was named by
Raleigh who, according to the native story, camped
there when he was pushing his way up the Orinoco
in search of the fabled El Dorado, with its golden
city of Manoa. Just above Barrancas are the ruins
of a strong fort that he built as a safe abiding place
for a part of his force while he went farther on up
the river. It is, perhaps, the irony of an unkind fate
which pursued the great adventurer, that near this
fort, from which searching parties were sent out, is
the rich mine of El Callao, whose gold probably gave
rise to the stories that started Raleigh on his heroic
hunt for the shining city that was the objective point
of all of the Argonauts who followed Columbus and
Ojeda. If Raleigh had been looking for gold by the
pound instead of by the ton and had searched more
carefully he probably would have found enough to
satisfy him.</p>

<p>Stretching away to unmeasured lengths from the
pin prick which the headquarters village made in it,
was the virgin forest, with its wealth of gold and iron,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
rubber and asphalt, and its square miles of mahogany,
Spanish cedar, rosewood, carapo, greenheart, and
mora wood, all within the confines of our concession.
Far off to the southwest, in a region which I never
could find time to explore, was the mythical dwelling
place of the people whom Raleigh described,
though only on the word of the natives, as having no
heads but with eyes in their shoulders and mouths in
their chests, with a long mane trailing out from their
spines. Down the Orinoco, half-way to the coast,
was Imitaca Mountain, a great hill of iron ore, which
is said to be one of the largest and richest deposits in
the world.</p>

<p>The letters which Crespo had given me to the Territorial
Governor and to the “Jefe Civile,” who had
immediate jurisdiction over the headquarters of our
concession, gave me a high standing and I proceeded
to conciliate the people, who had become disaffected
toward the old management, and lay plans for the
development of the property. The real boss of the
people of Venezuela is the “Jefe Civile.” He has
complete jurisdiction over the people of his district,
which generally embraces a county, and is consulted
on all matters of argument, whether domestic, political,
or religious. His decision is usually final,
although an appeal may be taken to the Court of First<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
Instance in which his district is situated. His authority
closely resembles that of a French <i>prefect</i>, and
admits of an intimate knowledge of the private life
of the people. Practically, there are no secrets in
Venezuela. If two people stop in the street and talk
for a moment they are surrounded by an inquisitive
crowd. If a woman complains to the Jefe Civile of
her husband’s ill treatment, it is done with the windows
and doors open, in a room more or less filled
with idle spectators.</p>

<p>The Jefe Civile at Catalina assisted me in my effort
to open up the country and active operations were
soon under way. The natives, who were living just
as when Columbus discovered them, and wearing no
more clothes than could be noticed, were attracted by
the prosperity which it was presumed would follow
our development work, and little <i>pueblos</i> sprang
up along the river on both sides of us. These people,
working directly for the company or under a license
on a royalty basis, were employed chiefly in cutting
timber and collecting <i>balata</i> gum, which has many
of the qualities of rubber without its elasticity and is
caught by tapping the trees. The native labor was
not very satisfactory at the best, as judged by
American standards, and we imported some negroes
from Trinidad, who were little better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>Our concession covered a territory larger than the
State of Massachusetts, nearly all of which was <i>terra
incognita</i>. It was out of the question to think of
trying to go all over it, but, to gain an intelligent
idea as to the nature of the inland country and its
resources, I made one trip into the interior, toward
the disputed border of British Guiana, which was our
eastern limit. But for the boundary dispute between
Venezuela and England the Orinoco Company never
would have secured its concession, for the shrewd
Guzman granted it with the idea that the Americans
would colonize the territory and effectively resist
the British invasion, which he was powerless to do.
In their progressive search for gold—the continued
pursuit of Raleigh’s will-o’-the-wisp—the Englishmen
in Guiana were advancing farther and farther
into Venezuela and carrying the boundary with them,
or claiming that it was always just ahead of them,
which, so far as Venezuela’s protests went, amounted
to the same thing. It was, in fact, the sweet siren
song of gold that caused the establishment of the
three Guianas, so that the British, French, and Dutch
might prosecute the search under the most favorable
conditions.</p>

<p>My expedition Guianaward was the hardest trip I
have ever undertaken and yet one of the most interesting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
We had to make our own trail and though
I had a dozen men with me it was a tremendous task
to cut our way through the thick underbrush, never
before disturbed, which often barred our progress.
We could carry few supplies, but it was easy to live
off the country, for there was enough game to feed
an army. Not knowing what to make of us, the
jaguar, puma, tapir, and ocelot came so close that they
were easily shot, while overhead were millions of
monkeys, parrots, and macaws, to say nothing of
great snakes that would have made the fortune of a
menagerie manager. At long intervals, living on the
banks of rivers, we encountered a few wild Indians,
who were terrified until they found we were not tax
collectors sent out by the government to take them
into slavery on account of their inability to pay
extortionate taxes, which are levied for no other purpose
than to compel them to work for years without
pay. When they became convinced that we meant
them no harm they were very friendly and generously
offered us things to eat, which I was afraid to touch.
They never had seen a white man before, and I
regretted that some of my friends were not hidden in
the bushes to witness the reverence they showed me.
They were armed with bows and arrows, which they
used with wonderful accuracy, and crudely fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
spears, and wore nothing much but feathers in their
hair. They lived on fish and game, with yams and
plantains, and sometimes corn, as side dishes, and
native fruits for dessert, and they were the healthiest
looking people I have ever seen. I pushed into this
veritable paradise for all of a hundred miles, which
carried me close to the border, and discovered one
outcropping of gold which will some day be developed
into a rich property. Our progress was so slow
that it was two months before we were back in
Catalina.</p>

<p>After getting the development work well started I
left it in charge of the superintendent and returned
to Caracas. I was not yet ready to bury myself on
the concession, for that, I thought, was what it would
mean to become a fixture there, and, besides, I was
curious to know how things were going at the capital.
I stopped at Trinidad on the way to attend to some
business for the company and enjoy a taste of real
civilization, so it was early in 1897 before I resumed
my old confidential position with President Crespo.
The restoration was to be only temporary, he declared,
for he insisted that a fortune awaited me in
the Orinoco delta and wished me to become established
there. His term expired the following February
and I found that he had already decided on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
General Ignacio Andrade as his successor. He had
planned to continue as Dictator of the country, <i>à la</i>
Guzman, and spend much of his idle time, and money,
abroad, and he wanted a man who could be relied on
to keep his organization intact and turn the office
back to him at the end of his term, for the Venezuelan
constitution prohibits a President from succeeding
himself.</p>

<p>Donna Crespo, who besides being the greatest
smuggler in the country was a shrewd judge of men,
had taken a pronounced dislike to Andrade and advised
strongly against his selection. Without knowing
how truly she spoke she predicted that if Andrade
were made President, Crespo would be dead within
six months. I added my advice to the Donna’s, for
I knew Andrade was a weak man and one who could
not be trusted to hold the country with the tight rein
which his agreement required. Powerful friends of
Crespo in Trinidad also urged him to select a stronger
man, but he could not be moved. He credited Andrade
with having saved his life, on the occasion when
I sent a galloping warning of the plot to murder him,
and, as a monument to him and an evidence of his
friendship, he planned that he should be made President
by the first “popular election” in the history of
Venezuela. The peons idolized Crespo because they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
felt that he was more nearly one of their own class,
as compared with aristocrats of the Guzman Blanco
type. He was so well liked by the common people
and had such a strong grip on the country that he was
able to carry out the idea which his loyal friendship
inspired, but with disastrous results in the end, to
himself, to Andrade, and to Venezuela.</p>

<p>On election day the soldiers at Guatira, Guarenas,
and Petare, surrounding towns which I visited from
Caracas to get a close view of the unique proceeding,
doffed their uniforms and donned blouses, with their
revolvers strapped on underneath, marched to the
polls and voted as often as was required. Other
towns throughout the country witnessed the same
performance. The peons also voted for Andrade,
either because they knew Crespo wanted them to or
because the soldiers so instructed them, and they
kept at it until the designated number of votes had
been deposited. For a popular election it was the
weirdest thing that could be imagined, yet it was so
proclaimed. As though to disprove this boast it was
immediately followed by mutterings of discontent
from the better class of citizens, and on the night of
Andrade’s inauguration General Hernandez, the
famed “El Mocho,” who was Minister of Public Improvements
in Crespo’s Cabinet but an opponent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
of the new President, took to the hills at the head of
three thousand troops and raised the standard of
revolt. Crespo really was responsible for the curse
of Castro, for had he selected a strong man as his successor
the mountain brigand never could have commanded
a force sufficiently powerful to overthrow
him.</p>

<p>Within a month Andrade went through the form
of appointing Crespo Commander-in-Chief of the
Army, in order that he might clinch his dictatorship.
For a while Crespo contented himself with enjoying
his new title and directing operations from the capital,
but the Hernandez revolution finally assumed
such proportions that he took the field in person to
stamp it out. The two armies met in the mountains
near Victoria on June 12, 1898. Hernandez was
led into a trap, given a drubbing, and captured. After
the battle Crespo walked across the field and was
leaning over a wounded man when he was shot from
behind and instantly killed. It was claimed that the
shot was fired from the bush by one of the escaped
rebels, and it was so reported, but no one who was at
all on the inside accepted this explanation. The bullet
that killed Crespo was of a peculiar pattern and
exactly fitted the pistol of one of his own officers,
who was not a Venezuelano. I doubt if there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
another weapon exactly like it in the whole country.
The responsibility for the murder, for such it undoubtedly
was, could easily have been fixed, but the
cowardly Andrade refused to order a real investigation
and, of course, there was no prosecution.
Crespo’s body was packed in a barrel of rum and
brought to Caracas for burial.</p>

<p>The capture of “El Mocho” checked the spirit of
revolt, but not for long. Andrade had nothing to
commend him but his honesty, which quality was so
little understood in Venezuela that it counted for
nothing, and he became more and more unpopular.
He was surrounded by plotters, even within his official
family, and only their inability to agree on his
successor prevented his speedy overthrow. Some
few months after Crespo’s death, Castro, who had
made himself Governor of the State of Los Andes,
visited Caracas and called on Andrade with the demand
that he be appointed to an important position
in the new administration as the price of peace.
Andrade, to his credit be it said, not only refused to
appoint him to any office but flouted him, and Castro
left the Yellow House in a rage. He sought the councils
of Andrade’s enemies and, after many conferences,
it was arranged that there should be a general
insurrection early in the following Summer. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
question of filling the presidency was left open, with
the understanding that it should go to the leader
who developed the greatest strength during the campaign.</p>

<p>Castro went back to his mountain home, to discover
that his cattle had been seized and a warrant
issued for his arrest, at the instance of Andrade’s
friends, for cattle stealing. He resorted to his old
trick of dodging across the border, but a similar warrant
was secured from the Colombian Government,
which had no more love for the Indian upstart than
had the one at Caracas. In fact, Castro at one time
seriously had considered starting a revolt in Colombia
in the hope of gaining the presidency. With officers
of both countries searching for him he went into hiding
and remained under cover until May 23, 1899,
when he invaded Venezuela with a force of sixty <i>peinilleros</i>,
so called from the fact that they were armed
with the <i>peinilla</i>, a sword shaped like a scimitar.
They were of the lowest type of Indian, but brave
and hard fighters. His old cattle-rustling neighbors
hailed him with joy, for until then they never had
dreamed that any man from the mountains could become
a really important factor in Venezuelan affairs,
and more than a thousand of them flocked to his
standard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>Supposing that the other parties to the revolutionary
agreement would carry out their part of the
programme, and that he would join forces with them
as he neared the capital, Castro set out on his march
toward Caracas. Andrade had become so unpopular
by this time that he encountered little opposition, and
as he captured successive towns he opened the prisons
and the freed convicts fell in behind him. When he
reached Valencia, less than one hundred miles from
Caracas, he had an undisciplined but effective force
of three thousand bloodthirsty brigands. General
Ferrer was stationed there with six thousand well-equipped
regulars, and though he was by no means
enthusiastic in his loyalty to Andrade he did his duty
as a soldier, according to the quaint standards of the
country. He marched his men out and surrounded
Castro, with the exception of a conspicuous hole
through which the latter could escape, and then went
into camp for the night. This proceeding was in strict
accord with the ethics of that strange land. Except
in extreme cases it is the unwritten law that when a
rebel leader is encountered by a superior government
force, the regulars must surround him with a great
show, but be careful to leave a wide hole in their line
through which he can run away during the night.
Invariably he takes advantage of his opportunity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
it is officially announced that he “escaped.” Of
course, after a rebel chieftain has made several escapes
of this kind and still continues in revolt he is
surrounded in earnest, but harsh measures are not
resorted to until he has had ample opportunity to
escape or come into camp and be good.</p>

<p>Castro violated all the precedents of his plundering
profession by failing to run through the hole that
had been left for him. When Ferrer saw him the next
morning, in the middle of the ring calmly waiting for
the fight to begin, he was nonplussed. He could not
understand that method of warfare and, concluding
that Castro must be a real hero and perhaps, as he
even then claimed to be, a genuine “man of destiny,”
he solved the problem by joining forces with him,
for which he was subsequently rewarded by being
made Minister of War. Castro learned from Ferrer
that he was alone in the revolution, his promised partners
having failed to take the field on account of
bickerings and jealousies among themselves. This
discovery and the addition of Ferrer’s forces gave him
his first really serious notion that he might become
President, and he marched forward in a frenzy of
bombastic joy. He picked out a star as his own and
ceremoniously worshipped it. Clearly his star was in
the ascendant, figuratively at least, for at Victoria,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
only thirty-five miles outside of the capital, he made
terms with General Mendoza, who was disgruntled
with Andrade, and picked up another army. When
the tottering President heard of this final evidence of
disloyalty he boarded a gunboat at La Guaira, taking
with him a well-filled treasure chest, and went to
Trinidad. The alleged warship leaked badly and
Andrade, who had a sense of humor, sent word back
to Castro by her commander to have her repaired at
once so that she might be in better shape for a hurried
departure when it should come his turn to be
deposed.</p>

<p>By this time the people of Venezuela, ripe for a
change of administration and believing that no one
could be worse than Andrade, had begun to find out,
as had Castro himself, what a powerful person he
really was, and they accepted him as their master.
He entered Caracas without opposition on October
21, 1900, and, rejecting the modest title of Provisional
President, which his predecessors had used,
proclaimed himself “Jefe Supremo” or “Supreme
Military Leader.” He filled all important posts with
men from the mountains, on whose loyalty he could
rely, and as they were able to secure plenty of graft,
not one penny of which was overlooked, he very soon
had a tight hold on the country. One of his first acts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
was to release Gen. Hernandez. He soon found that
the old warrior was too patriotic and too dangerous
to be at large, so he slapped him back into San Carlos,
on the pretence that he was planning an insurrection,
and kept him there for years. On March 30, 1901,
Castro was elected by Congress to fill out the unexpired
part of Andrade’s term and in the following
February he was elected Constitutional President.
Then began in earnest his reign of robbery, through
the establishment of monopolies whose profits went
to his private purse, and his vicious anti-foreign
policy which, through the murders and injustices that
were committed in its name, made the Boxer uprising
in China look like a soft-spoken protest.</p>

<p>I was not in Caracas to witness the advent of
Castro, as I had returned to Catalina more than two
years before, immediately after Crespo’s funeral.
During my stay at the capital I had come into possession
of a block of stock in the Orinoco Company
which made it better worth my while to stay with it,
and I had become infected with the idea that if we
were let alone the concession could be developed into
a very valuable property. It was soon apparent, however,
that we were not to remain undisturbed. So
long as Crespo was alive I was all-powerful at Catalina,
but with his death my influence began to wane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
and the rights of the company to be trespassed upon.
The natives could not see how our concession, an
integral part of Venezuela, could ever be anything
but their own property; they could not, or would not,
understand that the government had given away territory
from which they could be debarred. It was
only the influence of the Jefe Civile that had kept
them in bounds before and with the death of my
friend Crespo, that official suddenly became at least
lukewarm in his loyalty to the law and to me. It naturally
followed that the natives overran the concession
and did more and more as they pleased. They
refused to pay royalty on the <i>balata</i> gum, which
they carried off in enormous quantities, and stole
everything except the headquarters building and the
iron ore, which was too heavy and not worth while.
The Jefe Civile himself violated the terms of our
concession and extortions of all sorts were winked
at or openly approved. As Andrade’s unpopularity
increased my troubles grew, for the natives took sides
and began to spy on each other, with the result that
false and malicious reports were sent to Caracas as
to the company’s attitude.</p>

<p>When the threatened revolution became a fact and
Castro took the field, Andrade assumed a much more
friendly air, but it was too late to be of any value.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
He sent General Marina up the Orinoco to try to
arouse enthusiasm for his cause in the east, which
section furnishes the only soldiers that can cope with
the hardy mountaineers of the west. Marina came
to Catalina and asked me to do my best to hold my
district in line for Andrade, and gave me his word
that if I did so the President would grant me anything
I asked for as soon as the revolt was suppressed.
At just about the moment this request was made
Andrade was fleeing from La Guaira and Castro was
assuming full control at Caracas.</p>

<p>Almost the first thing he did was to annul our concession,
on the ground that its terms had not been
complied with, along with a dozen others, as the beginning
of his war on all foreigners. I denied his
right to cancel our grant, especially as it contained
a clause which stipulated that any disagreement between
the government and the <i>concessionaire</i> should
be referred to the Alta Carte Federale, or Supreme
Court, for adjustment. As the case had not been
brought before that court I held there could be no
legal annulment, even if that power did rest in the
executive, which I denied. This contention was subsequently
upheld by the International Court of Arbitration,
following the blockade and bombardment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
the allied powers, which decided that our concession
was still in full force.</p>

<p>When Castro saw that we did not propose to submit
to his arbitrary annulment he undertook to drive
me out of the country. He realized that so long as I
remained on the concession we could claim to be in
full possession of it, and he proceeded to harass me
in every conceivable way in the hope of making it too
hot for me. Under our contract we were to nominate
and pay all of the officers within our territory and
the government was to appoint them. My old chief
of police, Abreu, was arrested and taken away on
some false charge, and a new man, Tinoco, in whose
selection I had no voice, was sent to take his place.
He was, I learned, a spy and had orders to send in
reports which would make it appear that the company
was stirring up revolts and otherwise violating
the terms of its concession. This I discovered in time
to induce Tinoco, with the aid of a pistol, to sign a
statement in which he denied all of his dishonest reports
and gave the company a clean bill of health.
He died soon afterward.</p>

<p>Castro created a military district known as the
Territorio Delta-Amacuro, which took in all of our
property, and made Catalina the capital, so that the
Governor and the other officials could keep me under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
their eyes. They all had instructions to make the
place so uncomfortable for me that I would leave.
Fortunately, when it received its concession the company
had bought the land on which its buildings were
erected. Only the fact that I was an American citizen
and held the deeds to the property restrained them
from expelling me by main force. However, I could
see trouble coming, so I dug rifle pits under the
porches on the two sides of the house from which we
could be attacked. I had plenty of arms and ammunition
and about twenty men of whose bravery and
loyalty I was sure.</p>

<p>I was prohibited from buying anything at the
<i>pulperia</i>, or commissary, and we were hard put to
it at times for enough to eat. We caught fish in the
river and my men stole out into the woods to hunt
at every favorable opportunity, but the moment they
left our property they exposed themselves to arrest
on some trumped-up charge. Sometimes we were
able to surreptitiously buy supplies from the natives,
and we managed to get along. I filed protests at
Caracas, with the Governor and with my company,
but they accomplished nothing. I was told by the
officials of the company that they were doing the best
they could, with representations to the State Department
at Washington, and that I would have to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>
the best I could, and I did it. The troops were continually
spying on us and annoying us with fictitious
charges, but it was a year or more before the government,
angered by its failure to get rid of me, resorted
to extreme measures. A new Governor was sent
down with strict orders to remove me, by force if
necessary. He advanced toward the house with about
seventy-five soldiers. I ordered my men into the rifle
pits and met the General at the gate.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” I demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” replied the commander, with
all the treacherous suavity of his race, “but I have
orders to take you under my care and escort you to
Trinidad in order that no injury may come to you.
Our country is troubled and the government is
anxious as to your safety.”</p>

<p>“My compliments to President Castro,” I told him,
“and assure him that I feel perfectly secure here, and
quite comfortable. You can also tell him that I propose
to stay here.”</p>

<p>“That is much to be regretted,” responded the still
overly polite general, “for in that case I have to inform
you that my orders are to arrest you and take
you to Trinidad.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” I said, imitatively, “I have to inform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>
you that you will find it impossible to carry out
your orders, and I advise you not to attempt it.”</p>

<p>“You mean that you will resist arrest?” he exclaimed
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Most assuredly,” I replied. “This is my property.
You have no right to invade it, for I have
violated no law of Venezuela. If you enter on it I
will fire on you.”</p>

<p>“But,” he almost shouted, as he waved his arms
excitedly toward his enervated patriots, “my men are
here to enforce my orders. You would be insane to
resist. You do not know the Venezuelan Army, sir.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” I told him. “I do know the
Venezuelan Army. It is you who is ignorant. You
do not know my army. It is because I know both
that I have no fear. You have not a shadow of right
for seeking to arrest me and your blood will be on
your own head if you advance.”</p>

<p>With this declaration which, in keeping with the
comic opera custom of the country, was delivered
with all of the dramatic effect I could throw into it,
in order that it might carry greater weight, I retired
to the house.</p>

<p>The General could see my rifle pits, but he did not
know how many men they held nor how well those
men could shoot. After a short consultation with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
staff he gave the order to advance, while he bravely
directed operations from the rear. As his men crossed
the line we fired, and eight of them fell. They continued
to advance and we fired again, dropping nine
more of them, while several others were hit. That
was too much for them and they broke and ran, leaving
seven dead and ten badly wounded. They did
not fire a shot, perhaps because our men were so well
concealed that Venezuelan marksmanship would have
accomplished nothing against them. The General
and his staff returned in an hour and asked permission
to remove the fallen warriors. After burying
their dead they returned to their steamer and went
on up the river. In three or four days they came
back, with their force slightly increased, and the General
again called on me to surrender, under penalty
of being arrested as a disturbing factor. I gave him
the same reply as before and after thinking it over
for a while he marched his troops away again.</p>

<p>That little encounter produced pronounced respect
for the Americans among Castro’s soldiers and they
did not give us much trouble afterward, though they
continued to annoy us for a time. With the establishment
of the blockade of Venezuelan ports by the
allies—England, Germany, and Italy—in the latter
part of 1902, and the signing of the peace protocols<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
at Washington early in the following year, there
came a cessation of hostilities against us. So far as
driving us off the concession was concerned, Castro
seemed to have given up the fight, but on account of
the disturbed condition of the country and the fact
that the government was known to be inimical to us,
it was impossible to do anything of consequence
toward the development of the property. This enforced
idleness eventually became intolerable and
early in 1906, the company in the meantime having
sent one of its officers to Caracas to protect its interests,
I returned to New York, after having held
the fort for ten years. I came back much poorer in
pocket, but with a fund of information regarding
Venezuela and its people.</p>

<p>I have been in every country in South America and
have studied all of them and there is no possibility
of doubt that Venezuela is beyond comparison the
richest in its natural resources. With the setting up
of a firm and civilized government, which must come
in the end, under an American protectorate if by no
other means, all of the fairy stories that were told
of it centuries ago will come true, and its development
will eclipse all of the dreams that have been
realized in our own country. It is a strange fact that
Cumana in Venezuela (their respective names then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
being New Toledo and New Grenada), which was the
first European settlement in South America of which
there is authentic record, was founded one hundred
years, less one, before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth
Rock. In each case there was a fervent prayer
for divine aid in establishing a Christian colony and
building up a great country. Why one prayer was
answered and the other was not is a matter I will not
attempt to explain.</p>

<p>Like her West Indian neighbors, of which beautiful
isles Americans now know so little, but of which they
will know much more when their flag flies over all of
them, as it must within the life of the present generation,
Venezuela has been treated most bountifully
by nature and most brutally by man. Cursed they
all may have been by the seas of innocent blood in
which they were barbarously bathed during their extended
infancy and their prolonged childhood, from
which they have not yet emerged. It seems that all
the powers of darkness have conspired to retard their
growth and hold them slaves to savagery. Accustomed
from the days of the Spanish <i>conquistadores</i>,
and the pirates who followed them, to being plundered
and persecuted in every way that the mercenary
mind of man could devise, the Venezuelanos
have grown so hardened to turmoil and torture that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>
has become second nature to them to live in an atmosphere
which generates riot and robbery. Their blood
is an unholy mixture of Indian, Carib, and Spanish,
with other and more recent strains of all sorts. They
are the most inconsequential, emotional, ungrateful,
and treacherous people on the face of the earth—and
yet I love them. The ambition of their leaders runs
only to graft, while the underlings yearn for war as
a child cries for a plaything. At the behest of some
self-constituted chieftain, who has strutted in front
of a mirror until he imagines himself a second Simon
Bolivar, they rise in rebellion, because it gives them
a chance to prey on the country, and, if their revolt
is successful, to continue and extend their preying.
But some day a real man will rise up among them and
lead them out of their blackness and butchery into
peace and prosperity, and Venezuela, with her wild
wastes of wealth, will become great beyond the
imaginings of her discoverers.</p>

<p>This is not the full story of my life but it tells of
some of the incidents which I have enjoyed the most.
My best fight was with old Moy Sen, the pirate king,
in the China Sea, and my closest call was when I was
sentenced to be shot at sunrise in Santo Domingo.
These events supplied the most delightful feasts of
the excitement which my nature has ever craved, yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>
I have lived well, in that respect, all along. I have
no disappointments and no regrets, except that this
existence is too short. If I had my life to live over
again it would be lived in the same way, though, I
would hope, with a still greater share of excitement,
because it was for just such a life that I was created.
What the purpose of it was I neither know nor care,
nor am I in the least concerned as to what my destiny
next holds in store for me. I hope, however, that in
some land with opportunity for wide activity, I will
be reincarnated as a filibuster and a buccaneer, and
that I will so continue until my identity is merged into
a composite mass of kindred souls.</p>
